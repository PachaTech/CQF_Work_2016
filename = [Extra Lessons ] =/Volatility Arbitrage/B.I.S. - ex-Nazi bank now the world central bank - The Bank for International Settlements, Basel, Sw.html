  The BIS is the most obscure arm of the Bretton-Woods International Financial
  architecture but its role is central. John Maynard Keynes wanted it closed
  down as it was used to launder money for the Nazis in World War II. Run by
  an inner elite representing the world's major central banks it controls most
  of the transferable money in the world. It uses that money to draw national
  governments into debt for the IMF.

<P>
I was on business-travel from city to city in Switzerland. After the work
in Basel I went straight to the BIS to see the buildings in real life.
<P>
In Basel, I noticed that there are two BIS-buildings, about a kilometer from
eachother. The 'Botta'-building at the Aeschenplatz is a former UBS-bank.
It has a door with the ABN-Amro-bank next door, very strange. ABN-Amro has
a indoor connection with BIS, I saw it with my own two eyes!
<P>
After that I went to Geneva via Evian. Evian-les-Bains in France was also
a place worth to visit.
<P>
I didn't dare to take pictures of some particular buildings, because through
my remarkable behavior in Basel I was followed by Securitas people everywhere
I went. There was no place in Switzerland where I had to introduce myself,
because Securitas already knew me in advance.
<P>
Of course I have been at 'Place des Nations', where all the global organisations
are based. Also I've been in the most-shattered bank in Geneva: the
UBS-headquarters, it was full of nasty punchholes in the glass windows because
of the quite recent demonstrations. Swiss people were really flabbergasted,
because such demonstration of hooligans at the anti-globalists demonstrations
are new to them.
<P>
Everywhere I went, I was protected by Securitas. 'Big Bro Securitas' was
watching me all the time. I enjoyed every minute of it, because of the
predictable manners of Securitas-employees. Also in Bern I was heavily protected
by Securitas.
<P>
Back in Basel I went into the BIS building at the Central Station Place to
try to open a bank-account. At that moment there was a press-conference going
on, how strange. The Securitas-guy in front of the building recognized me,
so he didn't ask a thing and let me go to do what I want to do. I asked the
receptionist to open a bank account, but he lied to me that BIS is a
private-bank.
<P>
After that I went to the Aeschenplatz and went in. The receptionist told
me frankly that the B.I.S. "IS NOT A BANK". Thanks, lady receptionist, that
was exactly what I wanted to hear, that BIS is not a bank. Now it is confirmed
by this BIS-employee!

<P>
TEN TIMES A YEAR - once a month except in August and October - a small group
of well dressed men arrives in Basel, Switzerland. Carrying overnight bags
and attach&eacute; cases, they discreetly check into the Euler Hotel, across
from the railroad station. They have come to this sleepy city from places
as disparate as Tokyo, London, and Washington, D.C., for the regular meeting
of the most exclusive, secretive, and powerful supranational club in the
world.
<P>
Each of the dozen or so visiting members has his own office at the club,
with secure telephone lines to his home country. The members are fully serviced
by a permanent staff of about 300, including chauffeurs, chefs, guards,
messengers, translators, stenographers, secretaries, and researchers. Also
at their disposal are a brilliant research unit and an ultramodern computer,
as well as a secluded country club with tennis courts and a swimming pool,
a few kilometres outside of Basel.
<P>
The membership of this club is restricted to a handful of powerful men who
determine daily the interest rate, the availability of credit, and the money
supply of the banks in their own countries. They include the governors of
the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Swiss
National Bank, and the German Bundesbank. The club controls a bank with a
$40 billion kitty in cash, government securities, and gold that constitutes
about one tenth of the world's available foreign exchange. The profits earned
just from renting out its hoard of gold (second only to that of Fort Knox
in value) are more than sufficient to pay for the expenses of the entire
organization. And the unabashed purpose of its elite monthly meetings is
to coordinate and, if possible, to control all monetary activities in the
industrialized world. The place where this club meets in Basel is a unique
financial institution called the Bank for International Settlements - or
more simply, and appropriately, the BIS (pronounced "biz" in German).
<P>
<IMG ALT="the bank of international settlements" ALIGN="Right" SRC="aeschenplatz03.jpg">THE
BIS was originally established in May 1930 by bankers and diplomats of Europe
and the United States to collect and disburse Germany's World War I reparation
payments (hence its name). It was truly an extraordinary arrangement. Although
the BIS was organized as a commercial bank with publicly held shares, its
immunity from government interference - and taxes in both peace and war was
guaranteed by an international treaty signed in The Hague in 1930. Although
all its depositors are central banks, the BIS has made a profit on every
transaction. And because it has been highly profitable, it has required no
subsidy or aid from any government.
<P>
Since it also provided, in Basel, a safe and convenient repository for the
gold holdings of the European central banks, it quickly evolved into the
bank for central banks. As the world depression deepened in the Thirties
and financial panics flared up in Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Germany,
the governors in charge of the key central banks feared that the entire global
financial system would collapse unless they could closely coordinate their
rescue efforts. The obvious meeting spot for this desperately needed coordination
was the BIS, where they regularly went anyway to arrange gold swaps and
war-damage settlements.
<P>
Even though an isolationist Congress officially refused to allow the U.S.
Federal Reserve to participate in the BIS, or to accept shares in it (which
were instead held in trust by the First National City Bank), the chairman
of the Fed quietly slipped over to Basel for important meetings. World monetary
policy was evidently too important to leave to national politicians. During
World War II, when the nations, if not their central banks, were belligerents,
the BIS continued operating in Basel, though the monthly meetings were
temporarily suspended. In 1944, following Czech accusations that the BIS
was laundering gold that the Nazis had stolen from occupied Europe, the American
government backed a resolution at the Bretton Woods Conference calling for
the liquidation of the BIS. The naive idea was that the settlement and
monetary-clearing functions it provided could be taken over by the new
International Monetary Fund. What could not be replaced, however, was what
existed behind the mask of an international clearing house: a supranational
organization for setting and implementing global monetary strategy, which
could not be accomplished by a democratic, United Nations-like international
agency. The central bankers, not about to let their club be taken from them,
quietly snuffed out the American resolution.
<P>
After World War II, the BIS reemerged as the main clearing house for European
currencies and, behind the scenes, the favored meeting place of central bankers.
When the dollar came under attack in the 1960s, massive swaps of money and
gold were arranged at the BIS for the defence of the American currency. It
was undeniably ironic that, as the president of the BIS observed, "the United
States, which had wanted to kill the BIS, suddenly finds it indispensable."
In any case, the Fed has become a leading member of the club, with either
Chairman Paul Volcker or Governor Henry Wallich attending every "Basel weekend."
<P>
<B>"It was in the wood-paneled rooms above the shop and the hotel that decisions
were reached to devalue or defend currencies, to fix the price of gold, to
regulate offshore banking, and to raise or lower short-term interest
rates."</B>
<P>
<IMG ALT="bank for international settlements - above this chocolate shop"
    ALIGN="Right" SRC="frey03.jpg">ORIGINALLY, the central bankers sought complete
anonymity for their activities. Their headquarters were in an abandoned
six-storey hotel, the Grand et Savoy Hotel Universe, with an annex above
the adjacent Frey's Chocolate Shop. There purposely was no sign over the
door identifying the BIS so visiting central bankers and gold dealers used
Frey's, which is across the street from the railroad station, as a convenient
landmark. It was in the wood-paneled rooms above the shop and the hotel that
decisions were reached to devalue or defend currencies, to fix the price
of gold, to regulate offshore banking, and to raise or lower short-term interest
rates. And though they shaped "a new world economic order" through these
deliberations (as Guido Carli, then the governor of the Italian central bank,
put it), the public, even in Basel, remained almost totally unaware of the
club and its activities.
<P>
In May 1977, however, the BIS gave up its anonymity, against the better judgement
of some of its members, in exchange for more efficient headquarters. The
new building, an eighteen-story-high circular skyscraper that rises over
the medieval city like some misplaced nuclear reactor, quickly became known
as the "Tower of Basel" and began attracting attention from tourists. "That
was the last thing we wanted, " Dr. Fritz Leutwiler, current president of
both the BIS and the Swiss National Bank, explained to me while watching
currency changes flash across the Reuters screen in his office. "If it had
been up to me, it never would have been built."
<P>
<IMG ALT="bank for international settlements" ALIGN="Right" SRC="frey01.jpg">Despite
its irksome visibility, the new headquarters does have the advantages of
luxurious space and Swiss efficiency. The building is completely air-conditioned
and self-contained, with its own nuclear-bomb shelter in the sub-basement,
a triply redundant fire-extinguishing system (so outside firemen never have
to be called in), a private hospital, and some twenty miles of subterranean
archives. "We try to provide a complete clubhouse for central bankers ...
a home away from home," said Gunther Schleiminger, the super-competent general
manager, as he arranged a rare tour of the headquarters for me.
<P>
The top floor, with a panoramic view of three countries - Germany, France,
and Switzerland - is a deluxe restaurant, used only to serve the members
a buffet dinner when they arrive on Sunday evenings to begin the "Basel
weekends." Aside from those ten occasions, this floor remains ghostly empty.
<P>
On the floor below, Schleiminger and his small staff sit in spacious offices,
administering the day-to-day details of the BIS and monitoring activities
on lower floors as if they were running an out-of-season hotel.
<P>
The next three floors down are suites of offices reserved for the central
bankers. All are decorated in three colors - beige, brown, and tan - and
each has a similar modernistic lithograph over the desk. Each office also
has coded speed-dial telephones that at a push of a button directly connect
the club members to their offices in their central banks back home. The
completely deserted corridors and empty offices - with nameplates on the
doors and freshly sharpened pencils in cups and neat stacks of incoming papers
on the desks - are again reminiscent of a ghost town. When the members arrive
for their forthcoming meeting in November, there will be a remarkable
transformation, according to Schleiminger, with multilingual receptionists
and secretaries at every desk, and constant meetings and briefings.
<P>
On the lower floors are the BIS computer, which is directly linked to the
computers of the member central banks, and provides instantaneous access
to data about the global monetary situation, and the actual bank, where eighteen
traders, mainly from England and Switzerland, continually roll over short-term
loans on the Eurodollar markets and guard against foreign-exchange losses
(by simultaneously selling the currency in which the loan is due). On yet
another floor, gold traders are constantly on the telephone arranging loans
of the bank's gold to international arbitragers, thus allowing central banks
to make interest on gold deposits.
<P>
Occasionally there is an extraordinary situation, such as the decision to
sell gold for the Soviet Union, which requires a decision from the "governors,"
as the BIS staff calls the central bankers. But most of the banking is routine,
computerized, and riskless. Indeed, the BIS is prohibited by its statutes
from making anything but short-term loans - most are for thirty days or less
- that are government-guaranteed or backed with gold deposited at the BIS.
The profits the BIS receives for essentially turning over the billions of
dollars deposited by the central banks amounted to $162 million last year.
<P>
AS SKILLED as the BIS may be at all this, the central banks themselves have
highly competent staff capable of investing their deposits. The German
Bundesbank, for example, has a superb international trading department and
15,000 employees - at least twenty times as many as the BIS staff. Why then
do the Bundesbank and the other central banks transfer some $40 billion of
deposits to the BIS and thereby permit it to make such a profit?
<P>
One answer is, of course, secrecy. By commingling part of their reserves
in what amounts to a gigantic mutual fund of short-term investments, the
central banks create a convenient screen behind which they can hide their
own deposits and withdrawals in financial centers around the world. For example,
if the BIS places funds in Hungary, the individual central banks do not have
to answer to their governments for investing in a communist country. And
the central banks are apparently willing to pay a high fee to use the cloak
of the BIS.
<P>
There is, however, a far more important reason why the central banks regularly
transfer deposits to the BIS: they want to provide it with a large profit
to support the other services it provides. Despite its name, the BIS is far
more.than a bank. From the outside, it seems to be a small, technical
organization. Just eighty-six of its 298 employees are ranked as professional
staff. But the BIS is not a monolithic institution: artfully concealed within
the shell of an international bank, like a series of Chinese boxes one inside
another, are the real groups and services the central bankers need -- and
pay to support.
<P>
The first box inside the bank is the board of directors, drawn from the eight
European central banks (England, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, France, Belgium,
Sweden, and the Netherlands), which meets on the Tuesday morning of each
"Basel weekend." The board also meets twice a year in Basel with the central
banks of Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, and other Eastern bloc nations. It
provides a formal apparatus for dealing with European governments and
international bureaucracies like the IMF or the European Economic Community
(the Common Market). The board defines the rules and territories of the central
banks with the goal of preventing governments from meddling in their purview.
For example, a few years ago, when the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development in Paris appointed a low-level committee to study the adequacy
of bank reserves, the central bankers regarded it as poaching on their monetary
turf and turned to the BIS board for assistance. The board then arranged
for a high-level committee, under the head of Banking Supervision at the
Bank of England, to preempt the issue. The OECD got the message and abandoned
its effort.
<P>
To deal with the world at large, there is another Chinese box called the
Group of Ten, or simply the "G-10." It actually has eleven full-time members,
representing the eight European central banks, the U.S. Fed, the Bank of
Canada, and the Bank of Japan. it also has one unofficial member: the governor
of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority. This powerful group, which controls
most of the transferable money in the world, meets for long sessions on the
Monday afternoon of the "Basel weekend." It is here that broader policy issues,
such as interest rates, money-supply growth, economic stimulation (or
suppression) , and currency rates are discussed - if not always resolved.
<P>
Directly under the G-10, and catering to all its special needs, is a small
unit called the "Monetary and Economic Development Department," which is,
in effect, its private think tank. The head of this unit, the Belgian economist
Alexandre Lamfalussy, sits in on all the G-10 meetings, then assigns the
appropriate research and analysis to the half dozen economists on his staff.
This unit also produces the occasional blue-bound "economic papers" that
provide central bankers from Singapore to Rio de Janeiro, even though they
are not BIS members, with a convenient party line. For example, a recent
paper called "Rules versus Discretion: An Essay on Monetary Policy in an
Inflationary Environment," politely defused the Milton Friedmanesque dogma
and suggested a more pragmatic form of monetarism. And last May, just before
the Williamsburg summit conference, the unit released a blue book on currency
intervention by central banks that laid down the boundaries and circumstances
for such actions. When there are internal disagreements, these blue books
can express positions sharply contrary to those held by some BIS members,
but generally they reflect a consensus of the G-10.
<P>
OVER A BRATWURST-AND-BEER lunch on the top floor of the Bundesbank, which
is located in a huge concrete building (called "the bunker") outside of
Frankfurt, Karl Otto P&ouml;hl, its president and a ranking governor of the
BIS, complained to me about the repetitiousness of the meetings during the
"Basel weekend." "First there is the meeting on the Gold Pool, then, after
lunch, the same faces show up at the G-10, and the next day there is the
board [which excludes the U.S., Japan, and Canada], and the European Community
meeting [which excludes Sweden and Switzerland from the previous group]."
He concluded: "They are long and strenuous - and they are not where the real
business gets done." This occurs, as P&ouml;hl explained over our leisurely
lunch, at still another level of the BIS: "a sort of inner club," as he put
it.
<P>
The inner club is made up of the half dozen or so powerful central bankers
who find themselves more or less in the same monetary boat: along with P&ouml;hl
are Volcker and Wallich from the Fed, Leutwiler from the Swiss National Bank,
Lamberto Dini of the Bank of Italy, Haruo Mayekawa of the Bank of Japan,
and the retired governor of the Bank of England, Lord Gordon Richardson (who
had presided over the G -10 meetings for the past ten years). They are all
comfortable speaking English; indeed, P&ouml;hl recounted how he has found
himself using English with Leutwiler, though both are of course native
German-speakers. And they all speak the same language when it comes to
governments, having shared similar experiences. P&ouml;hl and Volcker were
both undersecretaries of their respective treasuries; they worked closely
with each other, and with Lord Richardson, in the futile attempts to defend
the dollar and the pound in the 1960s. Dini was at the IMF in Washington,
dealing with many of the same problems. P&ouml;hl had worked closely with
Leutwiler in neighboring Switzerland for two decades. "Some of us are very
old friends," P&ouml;hl said. Far more important, these men all share the
same set of well-articulated values about money.
<P>
The prime value, which also seems to demarcate the inner club from the rest
of the BIS members, is the firm belief that central banks should act
independently of their home governments. This is an easy position for Leutwiler
to hold, since the Swiss National Bank is privately owned (the only central
bank that is not government owned) and completely autonomous. ("I don't think
many people know the name of the president of Switzerland - even in Switzerland,"
P&ouml;hl joked, "but everyone in Europe has heard of Leutwiler.") Almost
as independent is the Bundesbank; as its president, P&ouml;hl is not required
to consult with government officials or to answer the questions of Parliament
- even about such critical issues as raising interest rates. He even refuses
to fly to Basel in a government plane, preferring instead to drive in his
Mercedes limousine.
<P>
The Fed is only a shade less independent than the Bundesbank: Volcker is
expected to make periodic visits to Congress and at least to take calls from
the White House - but he need not follow their counsel. While in theory the
Bank of Italy is under government control, in practice it is an elite institution
that acts autonomously and often resists the government. (In 1979, its then
governor, Paolo Baffi, was threatened with arrest, but the inner club, using
unofficial channels, rallied to his support.) Although the exact relationship
between the Bank of Japan and the Japanese government purposely remains
inscrutable, even to the BIS governors, its chairman, Mayekawa, at least
espouses the principle of autonomy. Finally, though the Bank of England is
under the thumb of the British government, Lord Richardson was accepted by
the inner club because of his personal adherence to this defining principle.
But his successor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, lacking the years of business and
personal contact, probably won't be admitted to the inner circle.
<P>
In any case, the line is drawn at the Bank of England. The Bank of France
is seen as a puppet of the French government; to a lesser degree, the remaining
European banks are also perceived by the inner club as extensions of their
respective governments, and thus remain on the outside.
<P>
A second and closely related belief of the inner club is that politicians
should not be trusted to decide the fate of the international monetary system.
When Leutwiler became president of the BIS in 1982, he insisted that no
government official be allowed to visit during a "Basel weekend." He recalled
that in 1968, U.S. Treasury undersecretary Fred Deming had been in Basel
and stopped in at the bank. "When word got around that an American Treasury
official was at the BIS," Leutwiler said, "bullion traders, speculating that
the U.S. was about to sell its gold, began a panic in the market." Except
for the annual meeting in June (called " the Jamboree" by the staff), when
the ground floor of the BIS headquarters is open to official visitors, Leutwiler
has tried to enforce his rule strictly. "To be frank," he told me, "I have
no use for politicians. They lack the judgement of central bankers." This
effectively sums up the common antipathy of the inner club toward "government
muddling," as P&ouml;hl puts it.
<P>
The inner-club members also share a strong preference for pragmatism and
flexibility over any ideology, whether that of Lord Keynes or Milton Friedman.
For this reason, there was considerable apprehension last spring that Paul
Volcker would be replaced by a supply-side ideologue like Beryl Sprinkel,
and considerable relief when he was reappointed for another term. Rather
than resorting to rhetoric and invoking principles, the inner club seeks
any remedy that will relieve a crisis. For example, earlier this year, when
Brazil failed to pay back on time a BIS loan that was guaranteed by the central
banks, the inner club quietly decided to extend the deadline instead of
collecting the money from guarantors. "We are constantly engaged in a balancing
act - without a safety net," Leutwiler explained.
<P>
THE FINAL AND by far the most important belief of the inner club is the
conviction that when the bell tolls for any single central bank it tolls
for them all. When Mexico faced bankruptcy last year, for instance, the issue
for the inner club was not the welfare of that country but, as Dini put it,
"the stability of the entire banking system." For months Mexico had been
borrowing overnight funds from the interbank market in New York - as every
bank recognized by the Fed is permitted to do - to pay the interest on its
$80 billion external debt. Each night it had to borrow more money to repay
the interest on the previous nights transactions, and, according to Dini,
by August Mexico had borrowed nearly one quarter of all the "Fed Funds,"
as these overnight loans between banks are called.
<P>
The Fed was caught in a dilemma: if it suddenly stepped in and forbade Mexico
from further using the interbank market, Mexico would be unable to repay
its enormous debt the next day, and 25 percent of the entire banking system's
ready funds might be frozen. But if the Fed permitted Mexico to continue
borrowing in New York, in a matter of months it would suck in most of the
interbank funds, forcing the Fed to expand drastically the supply of money.
<P>
It was clearly an emergency for the inner club. After speaking to Miguel
Mancera, director of the Banco de Mexico, Volcker immediately called Leutwiler,
who was vacationing in the Swiss mountain village of Grison. Leutwiler realized
that the entire system was confronted by a financial time bomb: even though
the IMF was prepared to extend $4.5 billion to Mexico to relieve the pressure
on its long-term debt, it would require months of paperwork to get approval
for the loan. And Mexico needed an immediate fix of $1.85 billion to get
out of the interbank market, which Mancera had agreed to do. But in less
than forty-eight hours, Leutwiler had called the members of the inner club
and arranged the temporary bridging loan.
<P>
While this $1.85 billion appeared - at least in the financial press - to
have come from the BIS, virtually all the funds came from the central banks
in the inner club. Half came directly from the United States - $600 million
from the Treasury's exchange-equalization fund and $325 million from the
Fed's coffers; the remaining $925 million mainly from the deposits of the
Bundesbank, Swiss National Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Italy, and Bank
of Japan, deposits that were specifically guaranteed by these central banks,
though advanced pro forma by the BIS (with a token amount advanced by the
BIS itself against the collateral of Mexican gold). The BIS undertook virtually
no risk in this rescue operation; it merely provided a convenient cloak for
the inner club. Otherwise, its members, especially Volcker, would have had
to take the political heat individually for what appeared to be the rescue
of an underdeveloped country. In fact, they were - true to their paramount
values - rescuing the banking system itself.
<P>
On August 31 of this year, Mexico repaid the BIS loan. But the bailout was
only a temporary, if not pyrrhic, victory. With the multibillion-dollar debts
of a score of other countries - including Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Brazil,
Zaire, the Philippines, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and even Israel - hanging
like so many swords of Damocles over its sacred monetary system, the inner
club has "no choice," as Leutwiler has concluded, but to remain a crisis
manager. This new role has created considerable concern among the outer circle,
and even in the Bank of England, since the members who don't entirely share
the mentality of the inner club want the BIS to remain primarily a European
institution. "Let the Fed worry about Brazil and the rest of Latin America
- that is not the job of the BIS," a blunt representative of the Bank of
England, definitely not part of the inner club, told me. Others at the BIS
have argued that it does not have the experience or facilities to become
"a mini-IMF - putting out fires around the world," as one staffer described
it.
<P>
To mollify such dissent on the periphery, inner club members publicly pay
lip service to the ideal of preserving the character of the BIS and not turning
it into a lender of last resort for the world at large. Privately, however,
they will undoubtedly continue their maneuvers to protect the banking system
at whatever point in the world it seems most vulnerable. After all, it is
ultimately the central banks' money at risk, not the BIS's. And the inner
club will also keep using the BIS as its public mask - and pay the requisite
price for the disguise.
<P>
The next meeting of the inner club is Monday, November 7.....

Investor's Business Daily, May 1, 1992 summed up the character of the BIS
in an article entitled:
<P>
Why a Global Credit Crunch? Some say Little-known BIS Is Partly to Blame
- Despite its global anonymity, the BIS is one of the most powerful financial
institutions in the world ...
<P>
In the book Global Financial Integration: the End of Geography, author Richard
F. O'Brien further confirms the powerful role of the BIS:
<P>
In the financial marketplace, the trend towards some sort of global governance
is best represented by the efforts of bank supervisors under the aegis of
the Bank for International Settlements in Basel to impose common minimum
capital requirements on banks ... and to integrate and coordinate the supervision
of banking, securities markets and insurance ...
<P>
Financial World Magazine - February 16, 1993 "Where Has All the Money Gone?"
explains how the BIS has more recently flexed its muscle:
<P>
Even before Japan's equity markets began to contract, regulations put into
effect in 1988 by the Bank of International Settlement's Committee on Banking
regulation and Supervisory Practices had begun to exact a particularly heavy
toll on Japanese lenders. Those regulations require the world's bankers to
raise their underlying asset bases, the money against which they lend, to
8% to total capital, more than double the asset average of the 1980's.- J

The above graph [couldn't reproduce it here, see <A HREF="#below">below</A>
ed.] was created in order to bestow meaning in simplistic, delineated form
to such terms as 'free market', 'new world order' and 'globalisation' - terms
that have dominated political/economic terminology over the past two
decades-or-so, and the fact that it focusses on banks and bankers (a profession
endowed with the aura of authority in the eyes of the public) is quite simply
because, without money, those terms are meaningless. Indeed, the title itself
emphasises the role of money: After all, what is a banker if he's not a trader
in money? Similarly, 'globalisation' would be equally meaningless if such
politically omnipotent groups as the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral
Commission were not taken into account when assessing it's (globalisation's)
significance. Moreover, how is it possible to disassociate banker from politician
from businessman when, at times, one individual is all three - and, in any
case, they are constituent parts of a single entity: the corporate establishment?
Hence the inclusion of these two groups withinthe graph.
<P>
The Bilderberg (or BB from now on) was formed in 1954 out of the need of
corporate America to ensure cohesion of purpose on the part of its European
partners in the recently formed North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) - the twin
aim being to facilitate the flow of American capital into the region, and
to bring Germany into the Alliance (against, it should be noted, the wishes
of many of its partners). That it is a group endowed with enormous political
clout can be attested to by: (1) examination of the lists of committee members
and conference attendees over the years - together with the gravity and
importance of the subjects discussed at these conferences (NATO, understandably,
being repeatedly a key subject); and (2) these conferences take place under
very strict security cover supplied by the respective host countries - even
though implicit within the structure of this cabal is its unaccountable,
secretive nature.
<P>
The Trilateral Commission (or TRI from now on) was formed in 1973, its agenda
determined by the corporate-funded Brookings Institute and the Kettering
Foundation - with not-a-little-help from David Rockefeller of the Chase/Manhattan
Bank. That its projected formation should have been so enthusiastically acclaimed
by the BB Conference in Knokke (Belgium) in 1972 should cause no surprise.
Both corporate-controlled organisations, with linked membership, they shared
the same aim: increasing globalisation of their wealth and power. Certainly,
the BB with its total lack of any 'democratic accountability', must be in
agreement with the TRI's declaration (published in their "The crisis of
Democracy") that what the West needs most "is a greater degree of moderation
in democracy". Though, on second thoughts, the former probably thinks the
'the degree of moderation' somewht understated!
<P>
A further examination of both graph and list of bankers' names reveals that,
of the banking organisations, the Banks for International Settlements (or
BIS from now on) is self-evidently of prime importance on the international
scene - not only because of its prestigious membership (embracing as it does
the head bankers of the leading industrial nations) - but also because of
the significance of its links with other groups. This article will focus
on it, at the expense of the other better-known banking institutions, for
two reasons: (1) its prime ranking in the international hierarchy; and (2)
so little knowledge of it is in the public domain.
<P>
The BIS is the world's oldest international financial institution, having
been set up in 1930 with the twin aim of (1) coping with reparations/loans
from/to a very unstable post-World War one Germany; and (2) more importantly,
to act as a forum for central bankers in the future. As such, it was the
epitome of supranationality - able to circumvent all those orthodox ideals
that had, over the years, become synonymous with the concept of the 'nation
state' - such as 'love of country', 'patriotism' etc., - the danger, of course,
being that, in certain circumstances (such as a state of war), such circumvention
of patriotism by any of its board members could lead to them being accused
of treasonable offences.
<P>
In order to appreciate what followed, it is essential to offer a brief
resum&eacute; of the political/economic situation at the turn of the century:
the Industrial Revolution, having fostered the rapid growth of a capitalist
economy, inevitably gave birth to an ideal/dogma exposing the socio-political
discord inherent within that same system which was based on the concept of
one comparatively small group of people garnering profit from the wealth
created by the labor of a much larger group. Thus was Marxism born - leading
to the Bolshevik revolution in 1917.The USSR, now perceived by the industrial
nations as representing the very antithesis of capitalism, was henceforth
'the enemy'. The 'cold war' had begun, and its most blatant expression was
the birth of fascism in the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution - a birth
both induced and nurtured by corporations such as I.G.Farben, SKF, Ford,
ITT and Du Pont - corporation which were fast becoming multi-national in
nature..Enter BIS. Set up in 1930 (see above),it consisted, initially, of
a group of 6 central banks and a 'financial institution of the USA'. Granted
a constitution charter by Switzerland, it was henceforth based in that country.
That America was by then a financial force to be reckoned with on the
international scene is borne out by the fact that the first President appointed
to the BIS was Gates W. McGarrah (ex-Chase National Bank &amp; Federal Reserve
Bank).
<P>
By the late 1930's the BIS had assumed an openly pro-Nazi bias - much of
it disclosed by Charles Higham in his book "Trading With the Enemy", and
years later corroborated by a BBC Timewatch film "Banking With Hitler" (broadcast
in late '98). Two examples of such bias (there were many more) were: (1)
The BIS had arranged transfers into the account of the German's Reichbank
of $378 million of what was, in effect, gold looted from the coffers of the
invaded countries of Austria, Czechoslovakia, Holland and Belgium; and (2)
in the summer of 1942, plans for the projected American invasion of Algeria
were leaked to the governor of the French National Bank, who immediately
contacted his German colleague in the BIS, SS Gruppenfuehrer Baron Kurt von
Schroder (of the Stein Bank of Cologne), and by transferring 9 billion gold
francs to Algiers - via the BIS - the Germans and their French subsidiaries
made a killing of some $175 million in this dollar-exchange scam. Given the
membership of the BIS at that time, this was hardly surprising. On the board
were the following high-profile representatives of the Axis powers (there
were 4 others): Walther Funk (Pres. of the Reichbank); Kurt von Schroder
(above); Dr. Hermann Schmitz (Jt.Chm. of I.G.Farben); Emil Puhl (V/Pres.
of the Reichbank); Yoneji Yamamoto; and Dr. V. Azzolini (Gov. Bank of Italy).
It should be added that, of the non-Axis members on the board, many - such
as Montagu Norman (Gov. of the Bank of England) were Nazi sympathisers, and
that the President of the BIS from 1939 to 1946 was Thomas McKittrick, an
American corporate lawyer who had been both Director of Lee, Higginson &amp;
Co. (a company which had made substantial loans to the Third Reich) and Chairman
of the British-American Chamber of Commerce in London. His continued presidency
of the BIS after America's entry into the war in December1941 was approved
by Germany and Italy with this significant addendum to their note of
authorisation: "McKittrick's opinions are safely known to us".
<P>
With the above noted disclosures in mind, the policy of appeasement pursued
by Britain and France towards Germany in the pre-war period can now be more
readily understood. By concluding a pact with Hitler, Britain and France
- in effect - gave him the green light to advance eastwards (ref. "Mein Kampf").
Furthermore, the fact that they shared his endemic anti-communism blinded
them to the risk that they were running by negotiating from a position of
comparative military weakness - of which Hitler was perfectly aware - and
for which they paid a heavy price. It should also be added that the architect
of this act of appeasement, Prime Minister Chamberlain, was a shareholder
in ICI, which had ties with I.G.Farben.
<P>
In the late '30's, and more particularly during World War 2, given America's
great wealth - as opposed to Europe's straitened circumstances - it was
inevitable that the trade between the two would be of a one-way nature, from
the former to the latter. And not surprisingly, in view of the close relationship
between American and German corporations (as noted above), a substantial
portion of supplies went to Germany - often via fascist Spain - by ship and
tanker under flags of neutrality. Many of the financial arrangements covering
such trade were handled by BIS in neutral Basle. As an example of how substantial
this trade was: in mid-'44 Am,erica was supplying Germany with 48 thousand
tons of oil, and 11 hundred tons of much-needed wolfram (tungsten) per month!
The fact that this trade was illegal in the USA for much of this period -
and particularly after America's entry into the war in December '41 - did
little to stop such trade. The large corporations, such as Standard Oil and
ITT, saw to that. After all, then - as now - the US Administration was
effectively under corporate control (as it has been since 1933, during FDR's
term of office). Even the Secretary of Treasury, Henry Morgenthau, and his
Assistant, Harry Dexter White, aware as they well were of the part played
by BIS in this, could do little about it. In July '44, 730 delegates from
44 countries met at Bretton Woods to plan a framework for post-war international
trade, payments and investments - a conference which subsequently resulted
in the setting up in'47 of both the International Bank for Reconstruction
&amp; Development (IBRD, or World Bank) and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). The apparent inviolability of the BIS referred to above was perhaps
best illustrated by the fact that Resolution 5, calling for the dissolution
of BIS, was subsequently ignored and proven ineffective. The corporate
establishment had seen to that - as indeed, it had seen to all such previous
attempts.
<P>
With war's end now calling for a clearing of conscience, BIS's method of
achieving this was by stressing its somewhat euphemistic neutrality, while
playing down its less palatable, but quintessential supranationality. Their
annual report of 1946 - as quoted in the Times - stated: "It is noted that
the Bank has continued to supply the principles of strict neutrality, but
that circumstances have caused a further decline in the volume of its business".
Further: "Wars are the worst cause of monetary convulsions, and the first
condition for enjoying the benefits of an ordinary monetary system is to
establish and maintain a reign of peace". In view of their recent previous
history, the term 'irony' hardly does justice to the above statements!. This
report was, incidentally, the last to be signed by its President, Thomas
McKittrick: in June 1946 he was appointedVice/Chairman of the Chase National
Bank by its owners, the Rockefellers - presumably as a mark of gratitude
for the assistance rendered to them by the BIS during his presidency.
<P>
In view of the somewhat puzzling fact that this now meant that there were
in this post-war period three international financial/banking institutions
- all with the self-evidently similar aim of resolving the world's serious
economic problems - a brief, close look is called for in order to clarify
the situation. The first (and intriguing) fact to be noted here is that,
whereas the IMF and The World Bank have been frequently and conspicuously
in the public eye from birth, the BIS has adopted a low profile and remained
uncommunicative. This was an expedient tactic for the latter to adopt - for
two reasons: (1) it thus eluded any investigation into its previous financial
dealings with the Third Reich; and (2) more importantly, by so diassociating
itself from the IMF and World Bank, the latter would henceforth be widely
(though erroneously) regarded as the sole guardians of the worldwide economy,
thus allowing the BIS more latitude to follow the agenda set by the corporate
establishment - to whom, it must be recalled, they owed their survival.
<P>
This ambivalent relationship between the IMF/World Bank vis-a-vis the
BIS/commercial banks in the 70's is epitomised by Anthony Sampson in his
book "The Money Lenders": "The commercial banks in the meantime had created
a very different perspective, for the IMF now controlled much less of the
world's money. In 1966, the quotas which made up its capital amounted to
10% of the total world imports; but by '76 they made up only 4%"..."by '76
world annual deficits had reached $75 billion : of this, 7% financed by the
IMF; 18% by other official international bodies (governments and World Bank)
- remaining three-quarters financed by banks (commercial)". (Today, some
two-and-a-half decades later, the board members of BIS, between them, control
95% of the money in circulation). The reason for this apparent taking over
of such responsibility by the BIS from the IMF/World Bank is twofold: (1)
the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of exchange convertibility in the
early seventies exposed the irrelevance of the latter as agents for European
reconstruction; and (2) the latter being statutorily-appointed agents of
the UN, were therefore - ostensibly - accountable to a much wider constituency
than the BIS, and therefore politically less manageable by the corporate
establishment, whose primary aim in the aftermath of World War 2 was to ensure
the unrestricted flow of American capital into Europe. A flow considerably
eased by subsequent European integration, in which both NATO and the Bilderberg
played a crucial role. This aim was furthered by means of the US
Congressionally-authorised European Cooperation Act (ECA) of 1948, and
implemented by its subsidiary, the European Payments Union (EPU) of 1950
- both under the aegis of the Marshall Plan of 1947. Predictably, the BIS
was the institution chosen by the EPU to oversee this movement of capital
(a point worthy of note here is that the head of the EPU at that time was
one Richard Bissell, an economist who, years later, was to be the CIA Deputy
Director of Planning overseeing the Bay of Pigs fiasco in April '61!).The
BIS was now firmly ensconced in the heart of European integration, and was
subsequently to play a critical role in the events leading to its (Europe's)
eventual evolvement into the European Union, a bureaucratic politico-economic
body occupying a position of crucial importance within the wider global hierarchy
envisaged by the corporate establishment.
<P>
The significance of the American's key central role in this sequence of events
is underscored by the fact that, in the aftermath of World War 2, they (the
Americans) set up the Bundesbank in Frankfurt (in their zone of control),
ensuring that the bank would be independent of government and follow a strict
monetary policy - in effect, another Federal Reserve System. In 1948 they
replaced the existing Reichmarks with approximately 11 billion Deutschmarks,
and Germany's subsequent conduct vis-a-vis European integration must be viewed
with this in mind. In any case, the fact remains that Germany's subsequent
frequent delaying tactics enabled the dollar to consolidate its dominance.
<P>
In their published pr&eacute;cis entitled "Profile of an International
Organisation", the BIS states that its "predominant tasks are summed up most
succintly in part of Article 3 of its original Statutes. They are 'to promote
the co-operation of central banks and to provide additional facilities for
international financial operations'". To achieve this aim it has 3 administrative
bodies: (1) a Board of Directors, comprising the Governors of the central
banks of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the USA, each of whom
appoints another member of the same nationality - plus the central bank Governors
of Canada, Japan,Holland, Sweden and Switzerland: a total of 17. (2) A Management
Board; and (3) An annual General Meeting in June of each year.
<P>
That this is an organisation carrying enormous clout is readily confirmed
by a closer look at said synopsis, pertinent quotes from which follow (italics
are BIS's):
<P>
(A) "Since September 1994, the eleven countries from which the members of
the Bank's Board of Directors are drawn have been identical with the countries
which comprise the Group of Ten (G-10), with which the BIS has had a long
and close association".
<P>
(B) "As well as making resources available to the IMF under the GAB (General
Arrangements to Borrow) the G-10 has, since 1963, been a principal forum
for discussion of international monetary questions. From the outset, the
BIS has been a participant in G-10 Meetings, above all because the Governors
of the G-10 central banks meet regularly on the occasion of the Basle monthly
meetings. The G-10 meetings have, over time, become the pivotal forum in
which much wider activities have been set in motion by the G-10 central banks
in the pursuit of financial stability". (Meetings, it should be noted, hosted
by the BIS in their high-rise office block in Basle).
<P>
(C) "As early as 1971 concern among central banks about the evolution of
the Eurocurrency markets led to the establishment of a Standing Committee
of the Group of Ten central banks which has met periodically in Basle ever
since"
<P>
(D) In December 1994 the G-10 Governors set up "The Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision, the secretariat for which is provided by the BIS".
<P>
(E) "The BIS hosts meeting of, and provides the secretariat for, the Committee
on Payment and Settlement Systems and its various working parties".
<P>
(F) "..the BIS in a joint initiative with the Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision is establishing an Institute for Financial Stability ahich is
expected to commence its activities sometime in the second half of this year"
(1998).
<P>
(G) " From 1964 until the end of 1993 the BIS hosted the Secretariat of the
Committee of Governors of the Central Banks of the Member States of the European
Economic Community (theCommittee of Governors). From 1st of June 1973 until
the end of 1993 the Secretariat of the Committee of Governors also served
the Board of Governors of the European Monetary Co-operation Fund (EMCF)
and the Bank (BIS) acted as EMCF agent. Until they were replaced by the European
Monetary Institute on 1st January 1994, the Committee of Governors and the
EMCF were the Community bodies which provided the institutional framework
for monetary co-operation in the European Community".
<P>
(It should be added that the above quotes are by no means a comprehensive
listing in the synopsis of the BIS's activities on the global scene).
<P>
Three news items concerning the role played by the BIS are worthy of note:
<P>
(1) In 1994 the Belgian banker, Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy resigned from
his post as General Manager of the BIS in order to become Head of the European
Monetary Institute (EMI) - forerunner of the European Central Bank (ECB).
As reported in the Times of 10/11/'93: Andrew Crockett (Executive Director
of the Bank of England), who was replacing Lamfalussy as General Manager
of the BIS,.."said he did not foresee the ENI..impinging on the work of the
Basle-based BIS which is widely regarded as the central banker's central
bank"..and adding that.."The EMI would enable the BIS to re-focus on global
issues, and develop its role as a forum for collaboration between central
banks in the monetary and regulatory fields".
<P>
(2) C.Fred Bergsten, Head of the Institute for International Economics, told
the Washington Post on the 3rd of January '99 "The adoption of a common currency
is by far the boldest chapter of European integration. Money traditionally
has been an integral element of national sovereignty"..and the decision by
Germany and France to give up their mark and franc "..represents the most
dramatic voluntary surrender of sovereignty in recorded history. The European
Central Bank that will manage the euro is a truly supranational institution".
<P>
(3) In the Independent On Sunday of the 21st February '99 it was reported
that Andrew Crockett (see above) has been appointed Chairman of a
newly-established 'Stability Forum' (see quote 'F' above), whose aim is to
monitor global markets (this was the idea of Hans Tietmeyer, President of
the Bundesbank).
<P>
Certain conclusions can be drawn from a recapitulation of the facts noted
above:
<P>
(1) The BIS occupies a central role within the global/European financial
scene - to the extent that such institutions as the G-10 and ECB (among others)
play a surrogate role.
<P>
(2) The goal of the corporations is precisely the same today as it was at
the end of the Great War. This is inevitable, inasmuch as inherent within
the capitalist system is its obligation to the aggrandisement of profit.
<P>
(3) As a consequence, sovereignty - in the sense of a country's or organisation's
political independence - can be ignored and overridden. This is happening
today. The signs are there for all to see: Is America really in the Gulf
Region for the benefit of its inhabitants ('ragheads' in American parlance)?
Ask any oilman.
<P>
Are the two terms 'NATO' and the "International Community' really synonymous?
Ask any country not in the Alliance.
<P>
Is the 'Cold War' really dead? Ask NATO why it is still in existence.
<P>
Is it not clear that NATO's primary role in Europe is to act as corporate
America's anti-Marxist enforcer (even though the Marxism in question may
be of a purely nominal nature)? Ask the head formulator of NATO, George Kennan
(he may be dead, but his disclosure of the real reason for NATO's birth is
on record in the BBC's Lord Reith Lecture of 1957).
<P>
Has not the UN's sovereignty been by-passed time-and-time again over the
years? Ask its main debtor - America.
<P>
And finally, why is so little of the BIS in the public domain? Ask the
owners/controllers of the means of communication - the media.

The "big five" prime banks of Wall Street, the owners of the "Class A" stock
of the NewYork Federal Reserve Bank, are: Chase-Manhattan, Citibank, Guaranty
Trust, Chemical/Manufacturers-Hannover, and Bankers' Trust. The Class A stock
of the Federal Reserve has not been sold or traded on the open market since
it was hermetically sealed from the public at the end of the summer of 1914.
It is the exclusive property of Wall Street and European prime banks, whose
major stockholders are the trans-Atlantic Ruling Class. This pattern holds
true of Central Banks throughout the nations of the advanced capitalist sector.
The Big Five have interlocking directorates with the "Seven Sisters," the
Anglo-Dutch-American oil cartels: Exxon, BP (British Petroleum), Dutch-Royal
Shell, Texaco, Mobil, Gulf, and Standard Oil of California (SOCAL).
<P>
Several of these trans-Atlantic money and commodity cartels financed Mussolini
and Hitler and actively maintained their connections with the Reich throughout
World War II. They were also all actively involved in Stalin's Russia by
the beginning of the first Five Year Plan in 1928. None of this is really
secret-anyone can discover the facts by doing a little research. Nor should
it be considered a "conspiracy" (either by those who promote or deny the
essential facts of the matter) - bankers and businessmen have been "trading
with the enemy" for centuries. It is just one more example of "the wise
investment policy" of cartels like J.P. Morgan and Co. and Standard Oil of
New Jersey.

The seat of first world finance capital is Basel, Switzerland, where the
Central Banks of the Group of Seven (G-7) form the directorate of the Bank
for International Settlements (BIS). The G-7 include Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Canada, the U.S., and Japan. The G-7 are called the "Hard Currency
Countries" because their Central banks, corporations privately owned by the
Prime Banks of these nations, have acquired most of the mined, milled, and
ingotted gold of the world. Approximately 80 percent of this is in the vaults
of Credit Suisse, under the Berghoff, the airport in Zurich. A somewhat larger
formation, called the G-10, includes Belgium, Holland, and Sweden.

The U.S. has become the greatest debtor nation on earth because the Prime
Banks of the other nations of the G-10 (especially Britain, Holland, and
Japan) have purchased the U.S. government debt in the form of semi-annual
and tax-exempt U.S. Treasury Securities through the operations of the Federal
Open Market Committee, the Fed's window on Wall Street.
<P>
Of these U.S. Treasury Securities, 95% have been floated since the end of
World War II to finance the Cold War against the "Evil Empire." Now Communism
has been deflated as an enemy; nativist fascist movements are being pumped
up all around the globe and the aggregate Debt is approaching the net worth
of all the real estate and movables on the planet. Now, also, the U.S. and
Russia are joining their military and space programs, the U.S. is becoming
by degrees a full-blown totalitarian state, and the bankers are beginning
to foreclose upon the bankrupted minions and dupes within their new global
condominium.
<H3>
  The World Central Bankers' Bank
</H3>
<P>
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the "first beast", was founded
in 1930 and was the first entity to be called a "World Bank." Monetarist
and gold-based, it functions as a clearing house for the balance of payments
between nations. It operated throughout WWII as an interlocking directorate
and a clearinghouse for joint Allied and Axis high finance.
<P>
The World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF), the "Second Beast," was
founded in 1946, after being drafted at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, during
the war in 1944. The IMF functions as the collection agency for the World
Bank, much as the IRS functions as the collection agency for the Federal
Reserve Bank. The Wall Street branch of the Federal Reserve is the "fiscal
agent" for the IMF in the USA. The capital pool of the IMF consists of the
Prime Banks of the First World, which interlock with the First World (G-7)
military-industrial complexes and the oil conglomerates.
<P>
The IMF functions under the aegis of the United Nations, as a Keynesian paper
credit-mill, extending credit in the form of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)
to the Second and Third World debtor nations, requiring that they purchase
specified amounts of the currency of the G-7 nations, imposing "austerity
terms" upon their internal economies, and looting them by means of "repayment
schedules" of their natural resources and minerals. These are channeled through
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to the multinational cartels,
also headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.
<P>
With the implementation of NAFTA and the Uruguay Round of GATT, the real
wages of blue and white collar workers in the U.S. will be leveled in time
to near parity with the Third World. The last "Superpower," the United States,
is not the primary head of the G-7 Beast, but is, owing to its debtor status,
the last head, appropriately close to the horned tail, engaging
disproportionately in UN Security Council "police actions" around the globe.
<P>
International Capital, having gone "global," will increasingly employ the
blue-helmeted troops of the UN to enforce the hegemony of Capital in the
future.

On a bright May morning in 1944, while young Americans were dying on the
Italian beachheads, Thomas Harrington McKittrick, American president of the
Nazi-controlled Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland,
arrived at his office to preside over a fourth annual meeting in time of
war. This polished American gentleman sat down with his German, Japanese,
Italian, British, and American executive staff to discuss such important
matters as the $378 million in gold that had been sent to the Bank by the
Nazi government after Pearl Harbor for use by its leaders after the war.
Gold that had been looted from the national banks of Austria, Holland, Belgium,
and Czechoslovakia, or melted down from the Reichsbank holding of the teeth
fillings, spectacle frames, cigarette cases and lighters, and wedding rings
of the murdered Jews.
<P>
The Bank for International Settlements was a joint creation in 1930 of the
world's central banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Its
existence was inspired by Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, Nazi Minister of
Economics and president of the Reichsbank, part of whose early upbringing
was in Brooklyn, and who had powerful Wall Street connections. He was seconded
by the all important banker Emil Puhl, who continued under the regime of
Schacht's successor, Dr. Walther Funk.
<P>
Sensing Adolf Hitler's lust for war and conquest, Schacht, even before Hitler
rose to power in the Reichstag, pushed for an institution that would retain
channels of communication and collusion between the world's financial leaders
even in the event of an international conflict. It was written into the Bank's
charter, concurred in by the respective governments, that the BIS should
be immune from seizure, closure or censure, whether or not its owners were
at war. These owners included the Morgan-affiliated First National Bank of
New York (among whose directors were Harold S. Vanderbilt and Wendell Willkie),
the Bank of England, the Reichsbank, the Bank of Italy, the Bank of France,
and other central banks. Established under the Morgan banker Owen D. Young's
so-called Young Plan, the BIS's ostensible purpose was to provide the Allies
with reparations to be paid by Germany for World War I. The Bank soon turned
out to be the instrument of an opposite function. It was to be a money funnel
for American and British funds to flow into Hitler's coffers and to help
Hitler build up his machine.
<P>
The BIS was completely under Hitler's control by the outbreak of World War
II. Among the directors under Thomas H. McKittrick were Hermann Shmitz, head
of the colossal Nazi industrial trust I.G. Farben, Baron Kurt von Schroder,
head of the J.H. Stein Bank of Cologne and a leading officer and financier
of the Gestapo; Dr. Walther Funk of the Reichsbank, and, of course, Emil
Puhl. These last two figures were Hitler's personal appointees to the board.
<P>
The BIS's first president was the smooth old Rockefeller banker, Gates W.
McGarrah, formerly of the Chase National Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank,
who retired in 1933. His successor was the forty-three-year-old Leon Fraser,
a colorful former newspaper reporter on the muckraking NewYork World, a
street-corner soapbox orator, straw-hat company director, and performer in
drag in stage comedies. Fraser had little or no background in finance or
economics, but he had numerous contacts in high business circles and a passionate
dedication to the world of money that acknowledged no loyalties or frontiers.
In the first two years of Hitler's assumption of power, Fraser was influential
in financing the Nazis through the BIS. When he took over the position of
president of the First National Bank at its Manhattan headquarters in 1935,
he continued to exercise a subtle influence over the BIS's activities that
continued until the 1940s.
<P>
Other directors of the Bank added to the powerful financial group. Vincenzo
Azzolini was the accomplished governor of the Bank of Italy. Yves Breart
de Boisanger was the ruthlessly ambitious governor of the Bank of France;
Alexandre Galopin of the Belgian banking fraternity was to be murdered in
1944 by the Underground as a Nazi collaborator.
<P>
The BIS became a b&ecirc;te noire of U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry
Morgenthau, a deliberate, thorough, slow-speaking Jewish farmer who, despite,
his origins of wealth, mistrusted big money and power. A model of integrity
obsessed with work, Morgenthau considered it his duty to expose corruption
wherever he found it. Tall and a trifle ungainly, with a balding high-domed
head, a high-pitched, intense voice, small, probing eyes, pince-nez, and
a nervous, hesitant smile, Morgenthau was the son of Woodrow Wilson's ambassador
to Turkey in World War I. He learned early in life that the land was his
answer to the quest for a decent life in a corrupt society. He became obsessed
with farming and, at the age of twenty-two, in 1913, borrowed money form
his father to buy a thousand acres at East Fishkill, Dutchess County, New
York, in the Hudson Valley, where he became Franklin D. Rossevelt's neighbor.
During World War I he and Roosevelt formed an intimate friendship. Elinor
Morgenthau became very close to her near namesake, Eleanor Roosevelt. While
Roosevelt soared in the political stratosphere, Morgenthau remained rooted
in his property. In the early 1920s he published a newspaper called The American
Agriculturist that pushed for government credits for farmers. When Roosevelt
became governor of New York in 1928, he appointed Morgenthau chairman of
the Agricultural Advisory Commission. Morgenthau showed great flair and a
passionate commitment to the cause of the sharecropper.
<P>
Legend has it that on a freezing winter day in 1933, FDR and Morgenthau met
and talked on the borderline of their two farms. Morgenthau is supposed to
have said to Roosevelt, "Life is getting slow around here". And FDR replied,
"Henry, how would you like to be Secretary of the Treasury?"
<P>
What he lacked in knowledge of economics, Morgenthau rapidly made up in his
Jeffersonian principles and role as keeper of the public conscience. Close
to a thousand volumes of his official diaries in the Roosevelt Memorial Library
at Hyde Park give a vivid portrait of his inspired conducting of his high
office. He was aided by an able staff, which he ran with benign but military
precision. His most trusted aide was his Assistant Secretary, Harry Dexter
White. Unlike Morgenthau, White came form humble origins. Jewish also, he
was the child of penniless Russian immigrant parents who were consumed with
a hatred of the czarist regime. White's early life was a struggle: this short,
energetic, keen-faced man fought to help his father's hardware business succeed,
finally forging as an economist with the aid of a Harvard scholarship and
a professorship at Lawrence College, Wisconsin. He was opinionated and
self-confident to a degree. Although he was frequently accused of being a
communist sympathizer, he was in fact simply an old-fashioned liberal driven
by his ancestral memories of Russian imperialism.
<P>
It is unfortunate that Morgenthau did not appoint White as his representative
at BIS meetings, but White was too valuable in Washington. Instead, Morgenthau
sent the more questionable Merle Cochran to investigate the BIS. Cochran
was on loan to Treasury from the State Department; he represented the State
Department's sophisticated neutralism before (and during) the war. Cochran
became Secretary of the American Embassy in Paris, working directly under
Roosevelt's friend the duplicitous, Talleyrand-like Ambassador William Bullitt.
Cochran spent most of his time in Basle conveying to both Morgenthau and
Cordell Hull details of what the BIS was up. Very much opposed to White-
indeed, violently so- Cochran was sympathetic with the BIS and to the Nazis,
as his various memoranda made clear. Morgenthau took Cochran's political
judgements with a degree of skepticism, but continued to use him over White's
objections because he knew the Germans would trust Cochran and confide much
in him. Day after day, Cochran lunched with Schmitz, Shroder, Funk, Emil
Puhl, and the other Germans on the BIS board, obtaining a clear picture of
the BIS's plans for the future.
<P>
In March 1938, when the Nazis marched into Vienna, much of the gold of Austria
was looted and packed into vaults controlled by the Bank for International
Settlements. The Nazi board members forbade any discussion of the transaction
at the BIS summit meetings in Basle. Cochran, in his memoranda to Morgenthau,
failed to score this outrageous act of theft. The gold flowed into the Reichsbank
under Funk, in the special charge of Reichsbank vice-president and BIS director,
Emil Puhl. On March 14, 1939, Cochran wrote to Morgenthau, "I have known
Puhl for several years, and he is a veteran and efficient officer." He also
praised Walther Funk.
<P>
His timing was not good. One day later, Hitler followed his forces into Prague.
The storm troops arrested the directors of the Czech National Bank and held
them gunpoint, demanding that they yield up $48 million gold reserve that
represented the national treasure nounced that they had already shifted the
gold to the BIS with instructions that it be forwarded to the Bank of England.
This was an act of great naivet&eacute;. Montagu Norma, the eccentric,
Vandykebearded governor of the Bank of England, who liked to travel the world
disguised as Professor Skinner in a black opera cloak, was a rabid supporter
of Hitler.
<P>
On orders from their German captors, the Czech directors asked the Dutch
BIS president, J.W. Beyen, to return the gold to Basle. Beyen held an anxious
discussion with BIS general manager Roger Auboin of the Bank of France. The
result was that Beyen called London and instructed Norman to return the gold.
Norman instantly obliged. The gold flowed into Berlin for use in buying essential
strategic materials toward a future war.
<P>
There the matter might have been buried had it not been for a young , very
bright, and idealistic London journalist and economist named Paul Einzig,
who had been tipped off to the transaction by a contact at the Bank of England.
He published the story in the Financial News. The story caused a sensation
in London. Einzig held a hasty meeting with maverick Labour Member of Parliament
George Strauss. Strauss through Einzing began investigating the matter.
<P>
Henry Morgenthau telephoned Sir John Simon, British Chancellor of the Exchequer,
on a Sunday night in an effort to determine what was going on. Merle Cochran
had telegraphed him with a characteristic whitewash of the BIS and an outright
dismissal of Einzig's charges that the BIS was a Nazi outfit. Sir John said
icily on the transatlantic wire, "I'm in the country, Mr. Secretary. We are
enjoying our dinner. It is not our custom to do business by telephone."
<P>
"Well, Sir John," Morgenthau replied, "we've been doing business by telephone
over here for almost forty year!"
<P>
Sir John Simon continued to dodge Morgenthau's questions. On May 15, George
Strauss asked Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, "It is true, sir, that
the nation treasure of Czechoslovakia is being given to Germany?" "It is
not," the Prime Minister replied. Chamberlain was a major shareholder in
Imperial Chemical Industries, partner of I.G. Farben whose Hermann Shcmitz
was on the board of the BIS. Chamberlain's reply threw the Commons into an
uproar Einzig refused to let go. He was convinced that Norman had transferred
the money illegally in collusion with Sir John Simon. Simon, in answer to
a question from Strauss, denied any knowledge of the matter.
<P>
Next day, Einzing tackled Sir Henry Strakosch, a prominent political figure.
Strakosch refused to disclose the details of the conversation he had had
with Simon. But Strakosch finally cracked and admitted that Simon had discussed
the transfer of the Czech gold.
<P>
Einzig was jubilant. He called Strauss with the news. Strauss put a further
question to Sir John Simon in a debate on May 26. Once again, Simon hedged.
Winston Churchill was the leader of a violent onslaught on the unfortunate
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
Morgenthau demanded to know more. Cochran's letter from Basle dated May 9
and received May 17 brushed over the issue once more. Cochran wrote,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  There is an entirely cordial atmosphere at Basle; most of the central bankers
  have known each other for many years, and these reunions are enjoyable as
  well as profitable to them. I have had talks with all of them. The wish was
  expressed by some of them that their respective statesmen might quit hurling
  invectives at each other, get together on a fishing trip with President Roosevelt
  or to the World's Fair, overcome their various prides and complexes, and
  enter into a mood that would make comparatively simple the solution of many
  of the present political problems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This picture of good cheer scarcely convinced Morgenthau. On May 31, Associated
Press reported from Switzerland that transactions were completed between
the BIS and the Bank of England and the Czech gold was now firmly in Berlin.
<P>
During World War II, Einzig, who had never forgotten the Czech gold affair,
ran into J.W. Beyen in London and asked him if he would now admit what had
taken place. Beyen said smoothly, "It is all technical. The gold never left
London." Einzig was amazed. He wrote an apology to Beyen in his book of memoirs,
In the Center of the Things.
<P>
The truth was that the gold had not had to leave London in order to be available
in Berlin. The arrangement between the BIS an its member banks was that
transactions were not normally made by shipments would show up counts. Thus,
all Montagu Norman had to do was to authorize Beven and replace the same
amount from the Czech National Bank holdings in London.
<P>
By 1939, the BIS had invested millions in Germany, while Kurt von Schroder
and Emil Puhl deposited large sums in looted gold in the Bank. The BIS was
an instrument of Hitler, but its continuing existence was approved by Great
Britain even after that country went to war with Germany, and the British
director Sir Otto Niemeyer, and chairman Montagu Norman, remained in office
throughout the war.
<P>
In the middle of the Czech gold controversy, Thomas Harrington McKittrick
was appointed president of the Bank, with Emil Meyer of the Swiss National
Bank as chairman. White-haired, pink-cheeked, smooth and soft-spoken, McKittrick
was a perfect front man for The Fraternity, an associate of the Morgans and
an able member of the Wall Street establishment. Born in St. Louis, he went
to Harvard, where he edited the Crimson, graduating as bachelor of arts in
1911. He worked his way up to become chairman of the British-American Chamber
of Commerce, which numbered among its members several Nazi sympathizers.
He was a director of Lee, Higginson and Co., and made substantial loans to
Germany. He was fluent in German, French and Italian. Though he spent all
of his career inland, he wrote learned papers on the life and habits of seabirds.
His wife, Marjorie, and his four pretty daughters, one of whom was at Vassar
and a liberal enemy of the BIS, were popular on both sides of the Atlantic.
<P>
Early in 1940, McKittrick traveled to Berlin and held a meeting at the Reichsbank
with Kurt von Schr&ouml;der of the BIS and the Gestapo. They discussed doing
business with each other's countries if war between them should come.
<P>
Morgenthau grew more aggravated by McKittrick and the BIS as the war in Europe
continued, but did not insist he be withdrawn. He was forced to reply upon
Treasury Secret Service reports rather than upon Cochran for information
on the BIS's doings. He learned that in June 1940, Belgian BIS director Alexandre
Galopin had intercepted &#163;228 million in gold sent by the Belgian government
to the Bank of France and had shifted it to Dakar in North Africa and thence
the Reichsbank and Emil Puhl.
<P>
The Bank of Belgium's exiled representatives in New York sued the Bank of
France, represented by New York State Senator Frederic Coudert, to recover
their gold. Ironically, they were represented by John Foster Dulles, whose
law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, had represented I.G. Farber. The Supreme
Court ruled in favor of the Bank of Belgium, ordering the Bank of France
to pay out from its holdings in the Federal Reserve Bank.
<P>
But when Hitler occupied all of France in November 1942, State Senator Coudert
stepped in with the excuse that since Germany had absorbed the Bank of France,
that bank no longer had any power of appeal against the verdict. He pretended
that contact with France was no longer possible, while fully aware of the
fact that he himself was still retained by the Bank of France. He claimed
that only a Bank of France representative could allow the release of funds
from the Federal Reserve Bank. As a result, the gold remained in Nazi hands.
<P>
On May 27, 1941, Secretary of State Cordell Hull, at Morgenthau's suggestion,
telegraphed U.S. Ambassador John G. Winant in London asking for a report
on the continuing relationship between the BIS and the British government.
It infuriated Morgenthau that Britain remained a member of a Nazi-controlled
financial institution: Montagu Norman and Sir Otto Niemeyer of the Bank of
England were still firmly on the board. Winant had lunch with Niemeyer of
the Bank He gave an approving report of the meeting on June 1.
<P>
Niemeyer had said that the BIS, "guaranteed immunity from constraint in time
of war" , was still "legal and intact." He admitted that Britain retained
an interest in the Bank through McKittrick twenty-one months after war had
broken out. He said that he was in touch with the Bank through the British
Treasury and that British Censorship examined all of the mail by his own
wish. Asked about the issue of the Czechoslovakian gold, Niemeyer admitted,
"Yes, it had a bad public press. However, that was due to the mishandling
of the question in Parliament." He further admitted that the government of
Great Britain was still a client of the Bank and had accepted a dividend
from it. The dividend, it scarcely needs adding, came largely from Nazi sources.
Niemeyer said that he believed the British should continue the association
for the duration as well as lend the Bank their tacit approval, "If only
for the reason that a useful role in post-war settlements might later have
an effect."
<P>
Niemeyer went on, "It would be of no use at this time of raise difficult
legal questions with respect to the relationship of the various countries
overrun by the Germans.... McKittrick should stay in Switzerland because
he is ... guardian of the Bank against any danger that might occur... McKittrick
might want to get in touch with the American Minister in Switzerland and
explain his problem to him."
<P>
On July 13, 1941, Ivar Rooth, governor of the Bank of Sweden, wrote to his
friend Merle Cochran- who had returned to Washington- about the latest general
meeting of the Bank and the luncheon at the Basle restaurant Les Trois Rois
afterward. He said that it was agreed at lunch that McKittrick should soon
travel to the United State to explain BIS's position to "your American friends
...[in the] very correct and neutral way." Rooth continued, "I hope that
our friends abroad will understand the political necessity of committing
the Germans to send a division to Finland by railway through Sweden."
<P>
On February 5, 1942, almost two months after Pearl Harbour, the Reichsbank
and the German and Italian governments approved the orders that permitted
Thomas H. McKittrick to remain in charge of the BIS until the end of the
war. One document of authorisation included the significant statement,
"McKittrick's opinions are safely known to us." McKittrick gratefully arranged
a loan of several million Swiss gold francs to the Nazi government of Poland
and the collaborative government of Hungary. Most of the board's members
travelled freely across frontiers throughout the war for meetings in Paris,
Berlin, Rome or (though this was denied) Basle. Hjalmar Schacht spent much
of the war in Geneva and Basle pulling strings behind the scenes. However,
Hitler correctly suspected him of intriguing for the overthrow of the present
regime in favour of the Fraternity imprisoned him late in the war. From Pearl
Harbour on, the BIS remained listed in Rand McNally's directory as Correspondent
Bank for the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington.
<P>
In London, Labour Member of Parliament George Strauss kept hammering away
at the BIS. In May 1942 he challenged Sir John Simon's successor, Chancellor
of the Exchequer Sir Kingsley Wood, on the matter. Wood replied, "This country
has various rights and interests in the BIS under our international trust
agreements between the various governments. It would not be in our best interest
to sever connections with the Bank."
<P>
George Strauss and other Labour members of Parliament insisted upon Knowing
why the Bank's dividend was still being divided equally in wartime among
the British, German, Japanese, and America banks. It was not until 1944 that
they discovered Germany was receiving most of the dividends.
<P>
On September 7, 1942, Thomas H. McKittrick issued the Bank's first annual
report after Pearl Harbor. He went through the bizarre procedure of addressing
an empty room with the report to be able to say to Washington that none of
the Axis directors was present. In fact, all of the Axis directors received
the report soon afterward and the mixed executive staff of warring nations
discussed it through the rest of the day. The report was purely Nazi in content.
It assumed an immediate peace in Germany's favour and a distribution of American
gold to stabilise the currencies of the United States and Europe. This was
a line peddled by every German leader starting with Schacht. When Strauss
told the House of Commons on October 12 that the report had delighted Hitler
and G&ouml;ring, Sir Kingsley asserted that he had not seen it. Strauss went
on, "It is clear some form of collaboration between the Nazis and the Allies
exists and that appeasement still lives in time of war."
<P>
In the summer of 1942, Pierre Pucheu, French Cabinet member and director
of the privately owned Worms Bank in Nazi-occupied Paris, had a meeting at
the BIS with Yves Br&eacute;art de Boisanger. Pucheu told Boisanger that
plans were afoot for General Dwight D. Eisenhower to invade North Africa.
He had obtained this information through a friend of Robert Murphy, U.S.
State Department representative in Vichy. Boisanger contacted Kurt von
Schr&ouml;der. Immediately, Shr&ouml;der and other German bankers, along
with their French correspondents, transferred 9 billion gold francs via the
BIS to Algiers. Anticipating German defeat, they were seeking a killing in
dollar exchange. The collaborationists boosted their holdings from &#163;350
to &#163;525 million almost overnight. The deal was made with the collusion
of Thomas H. McKittrick, Hermann Schmitz, Emil Puhl, and the Japanese directors
of the BIS. Another collaborator in the scheme was one of the Vatican's espionage
group who leaked the secret to others in the Hitler High Command- according
to a statement made under oath by Otto Abetz to American a officials on June
21, 1946.
<P>
In the spring of 1943, McKittrick, ignoring the normal restrictions of war,
undertook a remarkable journey. Despite the fact he was neither Italian nor
diplomat and that Italy was at war with the United States, he was issued
an Italian diplomatic visa to travel by train and auto to Rome. At the border
he was met by Himmler's special police, who gave him safe conduct. McKittrick
proceeded to Lisbon, whence he with immunity with immunity from U-boats by
Swedish ship to the United States. In Manhattan in April he had meetings
with Leon Fraser, his old friend and BIS predecessor, and with the heads
of the Federal Reserve Bank. Then McKittrick travelled to Berlin on a U.S.
passport to provide Emil Puhl of the Reichsbank with secret intelligence
on financial problems and high-level attitudes in the United States.
<P>
On March 26, 1943, liberal Congressman Jerry Voorhis of California entered
a resolution in the House of Representatives calling for an investigation
of the BIS, including "the reasons why an American retains the position as
president of this Bank being used to further the designs and purpose of Axis
powers." Randolph Paul, Treasury counsel, sent up the resolution to the Henry
Morgenthau on April 1, 1943, saying, "I think you will be interested in reading
the attached copy of [it]." Morgenthau was interested, but he made one of
his few mistakes and did nothing. The matter was not even considered by Congress.
<P>
Washington State Congressman John M. Coffee objected and introduced a similar
resolution in January 1944. He shouted, angrily, "The Nazi government has
85 million Swiss gold francs on deposit in the BIS. The majority of the board
is made up of Nazi officials. Yet American money is being deposited in the
Bank."
<P>
Coffee pointed out that the American and British shareholders were receiving
dividends from Nazi Germany and Japan and that the Germans and Japanese wre
receiving dividends from America. The resolution was tabled.
<P>
There the matter might have lain had it not been for an energetic Norwegian
economist of part-German origin named Wilhelm Keilhau. He was infuriated
by Washington's continuing refusal to break with the Bank and its acceptance
of a flagrant alliance with its country's enemies.
<P>
Keilhau introduced a resolution at the International Monetary Conference
at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, on July 10, 1944. He called for the BIS
to be dissolved "at the earliest possible moment." However, pressure was
brought to bear on him to withdraw a second resolution, and he was forced
to yield. The second resolution called for an investigation into the books
and records of the Bank during the war. Had such an investigation taken place,
the Nazi-American connection would undoubtedly have been exposed.
<P>
Bankers Winthrop Aldrich an Edward E. (Ned) Brown of the American delegation
and the Chase and First National banks tried feebly to veto Keilhau's resolution.
They were supported by the Dutch delegation and by J.W. Beyen of Holland,
the former president of BIS and negotiator of the Czech gold transference,
despite the fact that Holland's looted gold had gone to the BIS. Leon Fraser
of the First National Bank of New York stood with them. So, alas, did the
British delegation, strongly supported by Anthony Eden and the Foreign Office.
After initial support, the distinguished economist Lord Keynes was swayed
into confirming the British official opposition calling for a postponement
of the Bank's dissolution until post-war- when the establishment of an
international monetary fund would be completed. Keynes's wife, the former
Lydia Lopokova, the great star of the Diaghilev Ballet who had made her debut
opposite Nijinsky, was a member of wealthy czarist family who influenced
her husband toward delaying the BIS's dissolution and a tabling of all discussion
of looted gold- according to Harry Dexter White.
<P>
Dean Acheson, representing the State Department in the American delegation,
was firmly in Winthrop Aldrich's camp as a former Standard Oil lawyer, smoothly
using delaying tactics as the master of compromise he was. The minutes of
the meetings between Morgenthau, Edward E. Brown, Acheson, and other members
of the delegation on July 18-19, 1944, at the Mount Washington Hotel at Bretton
Woods show Acheson arguing for retention of the BIS until after the war.
He used the spurious argument that if McKittrick resigned and the Bank was
declared illegal by the United States government, all of the gold holdings
in it owned by American shareholders would go direct to Berlin, via a Nazi
president. Acheson must surely have known that the gold was already deposited
for the Axis via the BIS partner, the Swiss National Bank, which shared the
same chairman. Acheson also argued that the Bank would help restore Germany
post-war. That at least was true.
<P>
Senator Charles W. Tobey of New Hampshire emerges with great credit from
the minutes of the meetings at the Mound Washington. At the July 18 meeting
he said, savagely, to the company in general, "What you're doing by your
silence and inaction is aiding and abetting the enemy". Morgenthau agreed.
Acheson, rattled, said that the BIS must go on as "a matter of foreign policy."
At least there was a degree of honesty in that. Morgenthau felt that the
BIS "should be disbanded because to disband it would be good propaganda for
the United States".
<P>
There were jocular moments during the discussion on July 19. Dr. Mabel Newcomer
of Vassar said that she "would not dissolve the Bank." Morgenthau asked her
cheerfully whether McKittrick's daughter was one of her students. She replied
in the affirmative. Morgenthau said, "She has informed my daughter that she
is against the Bank". Dr. Newcormer replied, "She didn't inform me, except
that she wanted her father to come home- so she might favour the dissolution!"
<P>
Everyone laughed. Morgenthau said, "She is very cute. She has read this article
in PM about it, and she said [referring to an attack on the BIS in that liberal
publication] ' I think PM is right and father is wrong'." Morgenthau threw
back his head and laughed again. "That is what Vassar does to those girls!"
<P>
Under pressures form Senator Tobey and form Harry Dexter White, Morgenthau
stated that Leon Fraser, McKittrick, and Beyen all had sympathies "that run
ther." In other words, in the direction of Germany. He said,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  I think in the eyes of the Germans, they would consider this as the king
  of thing which can go on, and it holds out to them a hope, particularly to
  people like Dr. Schacht and Dr. Funk, that the same [associations] will continue
  [between American and Germany] after the war. It strengthens the position
  of people like Mr. Leon Fraser and some very important people like Mr. Winthrop
  Aldrich, who have openly opposed this dissolution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Dean Acheson, fighting hard with Edward E. Brown at his side, said he "would
have to take the matter up with Cordell Hull." He was sure Hull would want
the BIS retained the since Hull had approved its existence up till now.
Morgenthau promised to call Hull, who had become acutely embarrassed by press
criticism. After four years of tacitly approving the BIS, Hull told Morgenthau
he called for its dissolution Morgenthau telephoned him and said, "What about
McKittrick?" Hull replied icily, "Let him read about it in the papers!" Later,
he repeated angrily to Acheson, "Let him read about it in the papers!"
<P>
Acheson went to see the British delegation on July 20. Closely connected
to high-level politicians in England, he was well regarded in Whitehall.
Lord Keynes felt that the BIS might be too quickly abolished if Acheson were
beaten by the Morgenthau faction. Although Keynes was advanced in years and
had a heart condition, he and his wife abruptly left a British summit meeting
and, finding the elevator jammed with conferences, ran up three flights of
stairs and knocked on the Morgenthaus' door. Elinor Morgenthau was astonished
to see the normally imperturbable British economist trembling, red-faced,
and sweating with rage.
<P>
Keynes repeated, as calmly as he could, that what he was upset about was
that he felt that the BIS should be kept going until a new world bank and
an international monetary fund were set up. Lady Keynes also urged Morgenthau
to let the Bank go on. Finally, Keynes, seeing that Morgenthau was under
pressure to dissolve the BIS, shifted his ground and took the position that
Britain was in the forefront of those who wanted the BIS to go- but only
in good time. Morgenthau insisted the BIS must go "as soon as possible."
At midnight an exhausted Keynes said he would go along with the decision.
<P>
Keynes returned to his rooms and contacted his fellow delegates from the
Foreign Office. The result of this late-night meeting was that he largely
compromised his original agreement and at 2 A.M. sent a letter by hand to
the Morgenthaus' suite again calling for the BIS to go on for the duration.
<P>
Next day, over the objections of Edward E. Brown and the great irritation
of Dean Acheson, Morgenthau's delegation approved the disposal of the BIS.
<P>
Immediately after the liquidation of the BIS was voted, McKittrick did everything
possible to combat it. He sent letters to Morgenthau and the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Sir John Anderson in London. He stated that when the war ended,
huge sums would have to be paid to Germany by the Allies and the BIS would
have to siphon these through. There was no mention of the millions owed by
Germany to the Allies and the conquered nations. Harry Dexter White sent
a memorandum to Morgenthau dated March 22, 1945, saying, "McKittrick's letters
are part of an obvious effort to stake out a claim for the BIS in the postwar
world. As such, they are, in effect, a challenge to Bretton Woods....The
other signatories to the Bretton Woods Act should be advised of the BIS action,
should be reminded of Bretton Woods' resolution Number Five, and should be
advised that we are not answering the letters."
<P>
The same day, Treasury's indispensable Orvis A. Schimdt held a meeting with
McKittrick in Basle. His comment on McKittrick's remarks was sharp: "I was
surprised that a voluntary recital intended as a defense of the BIS could
be such an indictment of that institution." When Schmidt asked McKittrick
the Germans had been willing to allow the BIS to be run as it had and had
continued to make payments to the BIS, McKittrick replied, "In order to
understand, one must first understand the strength of the confidence and
trust that the central bankers had had in each other and the strength of
their determination to play the game squarely. Secondly, one must realise
that in the complicated German financial setup, certain men who have their
central bankers' point of view are in very strategic positions and can influence
the conduct of the German Government with respect to these matters."
<P>
McKittrick went on to say that there was a little group of financiers who
had felt from the beginning that Germany would lose the war; that after defeat
they might emerge to shape Germany's destiny. That they would "maintain their
contracts and trust with other important banking elements so that they would
be in a stronger position in the postwar period to negotiate loans for
reconstruction of Germany."
<P>
McKittrick declined to name all save one of the little group, taking particular
care to hide the name of Kurt von Schr&ouml;der. Since he had to name someone,
he selected Emil Puhl. Nevertheless, he pretended that Puhl "does not share
the Nazi point of view." Orvis Schmidt was not deceived by this. He knew
perfectly well that it was Puhl who had authorized the looting of Allied
gold and its transferral to Switzerland and who had been talking to McKittrick
the day before in Basle about that very subject.
<P>
Schmidt closed in. He asked McKittrick whether he Knew what had happened
to the Belgian gold deposited in the Bank of France McKittrick replied: "I
know where it is. I will tell you. But it is extremely important world does
not leak out. It is in the vaults of the Reichsbank." Evidently he realized
he had said too much: that he had let slip his own role in the transaction.
He added hastily: "I'm sure it will be in Berlin when you get there. Puhl
is holding it for return to the Belgians after the war." This barefaced lie
scarcely impressed Schmidt. The gold was already in Switzerland.
<P>
McKittrick did not end there. He admitted that the Germans had sent gold
to the BIS and said, "When the war is over you'll find it all carefully
segregated and documented. Anything that' s been looted can be identified.
When gold was offered to us, I thought it would be better to take it and
hold it rather than to refuse it and let the Germans Keep it for other uses."
<P>
McKittrick continued, "I'm so sorry I can't ask you to take a look at the
books and records of the Bank. When you do see them at the end of the war,
you will appreciate and approve of the role that I and the BIS have played
during the war." They were, of course, never released.
<P>
Orvis Schmidt went on to see the executives of the Swiss National Bank, which
maintained its partnership in the BIS and shared the same chairman, Ernst
Weber. Schmidt raised the question of the looted gold: the $378 million in
gold of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Holland, and other occupied countries, including
the treasure of the Jews. He knew that by a technicality the BIS no longer
siphoned the gold through directly but sent it to its associated earmarked
account at the Swiss National Bank.
<P>
The Swiss National Bank officials told Schmidt that in order to be sure they
were not obtaining looted gold, they had requested a member of the Reichsbank,
whom they "regarded to be trustworthy," to certify that each parcel of gold
that they purchased had not been prised when the directors of the Swiss National
Bank informed him that that personage was none other than Emil Puhl, who
had just left ahead of his arrival . At the Nuremberg Trials in May 1946,
Walther Funk, still listed as a BIS director, testified that Puhl had American
connections and had been offered a major post at Chase in New York shortly
before Pearl Harbor. Funk admitted that Puhl was in charge of gold shipments.
He admitted receiving the gold reserve of the Czech National Bank and the
Belgian gold, and he added, "It was very difficult to pay [in foreign exchange]
in gold .... Only in Switzerland could we still do business through changing
gold into foreign currency." Funk said that Puhl had informed him in 1942
that the Gestapo had deposited gold coins, and other gold, from the concentration
camps, in the Reichsbank. Puhl had been in charge of this. Jewels, monocles,
spectacle frames, watches, cigarette cases, and gold dentures had flowed
into the Reichsbank, supplied by Puhl from Heinrich Himmler's resources.
They were melted down into gold bars; he did not add how many bars were marked
for shipment to Switzerland. Each gold bar weighed 20 kilograms. An affidavit
was read to Funk, signed by Puhl, confirming the facts. Puhl stated that
Funk had made arrangements with Himmler to receive the gold.
<P>
Funk unsuccessfully sought to disclaim responsibility for the scheme. He
dismissed Puhl's charges that the gold was plowed into a revolving fund.
Faced with a film showing as many as seventy-seven shipments of gold teeth,
wedding rings, and other loot at one time, he stuck his story. At one stage
he said that the loot was brought to the Reichsbank by mistake! His lies
became so absurd that they were laughable. When prosecutor Thomas E. Dodd
said to him, "There was blood on this gold, was there not, and you knew this
since 1942?" Funk replied weakly, "I did not understand."
<P>
On May 15, 1946, Puhl took the witness stank. Puhl claimed that he had objected
to the shipments as "inconvenient" and "uncomfortable"- a curious description.
He admitted that his "objections" were subordinated to the broader consideration
of assisting the SS, all the more-and this must be emphasized- because these
things were for the account of the Reich."
<P>
The prosecuting counsel read items from a report that included the statement,
"One of the first hints of the sources of [the gold] occurred when it was
noticed that a packet of bills was stamped with a rubber stamp, 'Lublin.'
This occurred some time early in 1943. Another hint came when some items
bore the stamp, 'Auschwitz.' We all knew that these places were the sites
of concentrations camps. It was in the tenth delivery, in November 1942,
that dental gold appeared. The quantity of the dental gold became unusually
great."
<P>
In October 1945 the Senate Committee on Military Affairs produced further
evidence of Puhl's activities. His letters to Funk from Switzerland in March
1945 were read out. They showed his desperate and successful efforts to overcome
the effects of the mission that month headed by Lauchlin Currie and Orvis
Schmidt. Puhl had constantly hammered away at McKittrick and the Swiss National
Bank in order to secure the flow of the looted gold of Europe. McKittrick,
brutally exposed by the Bretton Woods Conference's Norwegian delegation,
had- the letters showed- panicked, seeking to avoid direct receipt of the
gold. Instead, the Swiss National Bank, as BIB shareholder, would take it
into its vaults. But in order to camouflage the receipt of it, since the
Swiss National Bank had promised the Americans they would not receive it,
the Swiss National Bank had disguised it as payments to the American Red
Cross and the German legations in Switzerland. There was a starkly ironical
humour in this. General Robert C. Davis, head of the New York chapter of
the American Red Cross, was also chairman of the part- Nazi network Transradio.
As late as 1943, the German Legation in Berne was buying Standard Oil for
its heating and automobiles, which were supplied and repaired by U.S
subsidiaries. Tons of gold, thus laundered, poured into the Swiss National
Bank in those last months of the war.
<P>
In 1948, under great pressure from Treasury, the Bank for International
Settlements was compelled to hand over a mere &#163;4 million in looted gold
to the Allies.
<P>
Despite the fact that the evidence of the Puhl-McKittrick conspiracy was
overwhelming, McKittrick was given an important post by the Rockefellers
and Winthrop Aldrich: vice-president of the Chase National Bank, a position
he occupied successfully for several years after the war. In 1950 he invited
Emil Puhl to the United States as his honoured guest. And the Bank for
International Settlements, despite the Bretton Woods Resolutions, was not
dissolved.

<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)
is a committee of bank supervisory authorities from the G10 (i.e. the wealthiest
10 nations). They meet regularly at the Bank for International Settlements
in Switzerland and are in the process of putting together the international
agreement known as the Basel Capital Accord (BCA). This sets bank supervision,
risk-based capital and disclosure requirements for banks operating
internationally. These concepts are described more fully in Sections 2 and
3. The new BCA will effect the activities of all large international banks,
and will probably be adopted by more than 100 countries.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">While such an Accord might seem rather obscure and
irrelevant to the general public, this is perhaps more a feature of the general
ignorance, secrecy and complexity surrounding the operations of the international
banking and monetary systems than anything else. The purpose of this paper
is to act as a discussion document to start gathering concerns from various
NGOs working on monetary/finance system issues so that more comments representing
public interest issues can be submitted to the BCBS for its next comment
period in 2002.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">This Accord is of particular interest because of:</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT"><B>Increasing Power of International Creditors over
    Debtors.</B> International banks affected by BCA create the bulk of the money
    we all use in day-to-day living, especially the US currency which is the
    backbone of the international monetary system. The power of international
    creditors, particularly those responsible for money creation in the US Dollar,
    over debtors is increasing. This, in combination with the collapse of the
    gold standard and the original Bretton Woods structure in 1971, as well as
    the trend for western corporations to seek financing outside the banking
    sector, has lead to increasingly reckless behavior of these bank creditors.
    This is especially true where they can exercise their "powers" to access
    "collateral" (real assets) crucial to less powerful debtors - e.g. through
    IMF Structural Adjustment Programs internationally, and through predatory
    lending and foreclosures domestically. Such activities are increasing income
    and wealth gaps globally. Good supervision of, and appropriate capital standards
    for, powerful creditors can help curtail this recklessness.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT"><B>Increasing Financial Consolidation:</B> Both domestic
    and cross-border consolidation of financial services companies is continuing
    to escalate in the wake of global financial deregulation and the collapse
    of banks in various countries after financial crises. This is leading to
    the emergence of huge global "financial empires" domiciled in the same G10
    countries that create the "hard currency", dominate institutions such as
    the IMF and set the rules for international banking. Also, the bigger a financial
    corporation becomes the more it becomes "too-big-to- fail". Big creditors
    at the heart of the international financial system are very likely to get
    bailed out no matter what they do, for their collapse could collapse the
    entire global financial system. This creates a tremendous "moral hazard"
    proportional to size and global reach. This further increases the powers
    of large western creditors over sovereign nations.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT"><B>Trends in Bank Supervision and Financial
    Convergence.</B> The new BCA comes at a time of significant changes in the
    supervision of large banking operations. In the Western nations, over the
    past decade or so, we have seen insurance, banking and brokerage operations
    all merge together. One of the last countries to jump on this bandwagon was
    the United States with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999. This made the
    Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, the new umbrella
    supervisor of financial conglomerates. The potential for conflicts of interest
    arising from the driver of monetary policy for the linchpin currency also
    regulating and supervising large financial players are enormous. Most other
    countries employ a fully separate government body for this regulatory role
    and one under democratic control. This strange move in the US could have
    significant worldwide impacts.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT"><B>Moral Hazard Created by the IMF.</B> The larger
    international banks affected by BCA also seem to be the primary beneficiaries
    of the IMF bailouts associated with many recent financial crises. IMF bailouts
    are the insurance provided by the general public if the risk-management
    strategies of large creditors (including the holding of risk-based capital)
    fail. In one sense strong risk-based capital requirements can provide an
    antidote to the increasing "moral hazard" created by the IMF bailouts. Risk-based
    capital can be used to prevent crises by forcing international creditors
    to take more responsibility for the risks they assume and this will help
    prevent the need for severe "cures". It forms a "capital charge" on banking
    institutions, similar in effect to what the Tobin Tax would do to international
    speculators in general. A charge on the banking sector is most crucial because
    they are the most likely to get bailouts.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT"><B>Increasing Complexity of Financial Instruments.
    </B>Convergence of financial players, increasing consolidation of wealth
    in fewer hands, hedging strategies and innovative regulatory avoidance have
    created whole new worlds of complex financial instruments. The regulators
    themselves are admitting that this makes it increasingly difficult to really
    understand what is going on at these financial conglomerates and, in fact,
    to regulate them. As we shall see, this is reflected extensively throughout
    the new BCA with the development that "sophisticated" banking operations
    will be able to set their own capital requirements to a very large extent.
    This may be the first step toward "self-supervision" of banks, which is
    especially dangerous as "too-big-to-fail" risks and dependence on IMF "cures"
    increase.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT"><B>Domestic Predatory Lending and Credit Access for
    Low/Middle Income:</B> Within the US, in the sub-prime market, banks have
    been incented to assess good credit risks (that should get a prime rate)
    as sub-prime because they could charge a higher interest rate without having
    to hold higher capital. Presently in the US extensive problems have emerged
    with respect to bank's activities in low and middle-income groups. Bank capital
    requirements should address such exploitation of the poor, and supervision
    requirements in general should address the whole issue of credit access on
    reasonable terms for low/middle income groups. These issues are not presently
    addressed at all in the existing BCA.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">In the following sections I wish to unravel some of
the main features of the Basel Capital Accord and highlight what I perceive
as some of the issues that the general public should be concerned about.
In doing so I will attempt to relate the significance of BCA to these
above-mentioned issues of global finance sector deregulation, mergers and
acquisitions, IMF bailouts, low income credit access, bank supervision trends,
and the general imbalance in creditor/debtor relations.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">However it should be noted that I am making these
observations and drawing conclusions based on public information analyzed
using skills acquired in my own training as an actuary who has been primarily
concerned with the insurance industry throughout my career. In looking at
the banking sector extensive information about exactly what is going on
underneath is not easy to find in the public domain.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Based on public information it is not easy to fully
understand a bank's risk exposures and it has been widely acknowledged by
many bank industry watchers that this is a key part of the success of the
monetary system. For the monetary system is no more than a confidence game
and this requires confidence in the banks at all times, especially those
responsible for the creation of the linchpin currency - the US Dollar.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">This necessary "secrecy" surrounding the monetary
system in order to keep confidence in the ($US driven) financial system probably
has a lot to do with the secrecy that surrounds institutions like the IMF.
Public information from the IMF does not reveal how bailout sums are determined
or what creditors are at the other end of the bailout packages. Nor do public
bank financial statements reveal such details. It is highly likely that the
main beneficiaries of IMF bailouts are large western creditors with banking
licenses (and therefore those "regulated" under BCA standards) since these
institutions sit closest to the heart of the international monetary system.
Any large hit to their balance sheet is most likely to threaten global financial
stability.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">In no way do the opinions expressed herein reflect
the views of my employer nor the views of the professional actuarial societies
of which I am a member. In fact the International Actuarial Society, representing
these organizations, has submitted public comments on BCA that do not overlap
at all with the concerns expressed herein. Nevertheless I consider it the
duty of any professional to consider the broader public implications of the
goings on in their profession. My profession is built around the practice
of financial risk management and it is my opinion that the financial and
other risks to the broader public of the global financial order are unacceptable,
so this is why I write this paper. I do not consider this exercise to be
inconsistent with my duty as an actuary to sound alarm bells when risks are
getting out of hand.</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
2.&nbsp;<A NAME="background"></A><B><FONT face="Zurich BT"><FONT size=+1>Background
to Development of Basel Capital Accord (BCA)</FONT></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The first BCA came into existence in 1988. More
information about the original Accord can be found at the web site of the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) at
<A href="http://www.bis.org/">www.bis.org</A>. The BIS is an international
bank for central bankers, whose dominant members are the central banks (NOT
governments) of the G-10 + Switzerland. More recently other countries' central
banks have been able to join the BIS but it is dominated by the G-10. I cannot
be certain of all the things the BIS does but I think it is important to
note that this is the main place for the meeting of minds of the world's
most powerful central bankers. These meetings are conducted in private, as
are the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee and Federal Advisory Council
meetings. No doubt, very key decisions about the international monetary system
- the same monetary system we all depend on - are made behind these closed
doors.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The BCA of 1988, according to the BIS web site, came
out of the need to set consistent capital standards for international banks
so that one country's banking sector would not have regulatory advantages
over another. A "behind-the-scenes look" would reveal that in the late 1980s
the US and other bank regulators saw the need to introduce better risk-based
capital requirements in the wake of the emerging Savings and Loans Debacle
and the Latin American Debt Crisis. In both crises the banks were holding
capital way short of what the risk of default of their loans implied and
this ultimately led to the need for bailouts (from US public and Latin American
public).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The BIS web site also states that the new BCA is coming
out of a need to get away from "one size fits all" requirements, and the
need to better incorporate operational and market risks (to be discussed
in Section 3) into capital requirements. They also state that "sophisticated"
banks should be allowed to use their own internal risk management techniques
to set their own capital levels. A behind-the-scenes look reveals that the
financial crises of the 1990's and subsequent IMF bailouts scared the heck
out of those at the helm of the financial system. They found that the old
BCA did not have a sufficient capital charge for very risky cross-border
loans over that for safer ones. Hence many creditors were incented to engage
in very risky cross-border financing which played a large role, not only
in triggering the crisis, but also in all the trouble the western creditors
found themselves in once the crisis emerged.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The meetings of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
(BCBS), responsible for the BCA, are hosted by the BIS and are also conducted
behind closed doors. Public input into draft BCA documents has been welcomed,
however, and this opportunity has certainly been utilized by the global finance
sector. So far the major groups of NGOs opposed to the Bretton Woods institutions
and the global financial order have not provided input and I am certain the
BCBS is not expecting them to. Therefore it would be very nice to give them
the big surprise of public input from the members of the public who are not
large, powerful financial players. This makes sense especially because this
public is called upon to bailout banks whose capital can't cover their
risks.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The latest "public" comment period ended on May
31<SUP>st</SUP> 2001. Due to the extensive complaints received from the banking
sector (who, of course, wish to hold less capital and be less supervised)
the BCBS is saying that they will have another round of comments for another
(more bank friendly, no doubt) revised draft in 2002. It is important to
note that the BCBS is currently chaired by William McDonough, the current
President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and who therefore sits
on the Federal Open Markets Committee - THE committee that determines monetary
policy for the world's linchpin currency.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">As noted, the BCBS is composed of central bankers
from the G-10. This is a critical observation for several reasons. First,
bank supervision standards are being set only by the wealthy countries that
create all the "hard currency". Second, bank supervision standards are being
set by those responsible for monetary policy, not by separate national government
bodies responsible for bank supervision. The domination by central bankers
in this process means that most of the input will come directly out of the
banking sector, rather than the general public or their elected
representatives.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">In a better world a large part of the role of bank
supervision would be to protect some balance of power between creditors and
debtors. Instead the large international banks seem to be moving into a world
where they are gaining more ability to "supervise themselves" and this will
become more evident as we study BCA. The structure of the BCBS and its role
in producing the BCA is consistent with this observation.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">In a much better world the actual process of money
origination would be democratic, which it is far from today. The reality
is that we are stuck with the international monetary system based on the
US dollar because that is what people all over the world have placed their
confidence and trust in. This is unlikely to change in any hurry, though
baby steps are being taken with the emergence of local currencies. In the
meantime it makes sense to focus attention on the supervision of those with
credit creation powers in the dominant "trusted monetary system", regardless
of how unsavory this system and its major players have become.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">It is important to note that BCA covers ONLY international
banking institutions. It does not cover non-bank financial institutions (NBFI).
In one sense it is quite reasonable that banks should have tougher capital
requirements and supervision standards on them for the following
reasons:</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">They have the special privilege of being able to "create
    money out of thin air", and must use that privilege responsibly else the
    safety of the whole financial system is put at risk.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">They have various guarantees or bailout mechanisms
    backing them up such as FDIC funds and, of course, the IMF bailouts that
    nobody wants to give us too much information on.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">However the emergence of the NBFIs poses a problem
and this is giving the banks a lot of leverage in arguing against tough capital
requirements. Basically NBFIs have emerged as a result of huge accumulation
of financial capital into few hands and the development of new instruments
such as loan-backed securities. This means that large NBFIs without a banking
license (who do not create M3 money) can compete with bank financiers, so
they may have an advantage if banks have to comply with tougher capital and
supervision requirements.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Hence many banks are approaching the BCBS with the
complaint that the BCA unfairly penalizes them for being a bank. Rather than
ignoring these arguments on the basis that the banking sector has privileged
access to various bailout mechanisms that NBFIs don&#146;t, I fear that the
BCBS may cave in to such arguments. Hence it is important for the concerned
public to remind the BCBS of these things and this makes it even more important
to get access to the list of creditors benefiting from the IMF bailouts.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">If NBFIs are also benefiting from these bailouts then
maybe the solution is that NBFIs also need something similar to the BCA.
In any case that would be recommended from the point of view of prevention
of crises for tougher capital requirements help curtail speculative
activity.</FONT>

<FONT face="Zurich BT">The BCA contains what are known as the three pillars
of bank supervision. These are:</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">Pillar 1: Risk-Based Capital Requirements</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">Pillar 2: Supervisory Review Process</FONT>

<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Each of these are now discussed in turn:</FONT>
<OL TYPE="a">
  <LI>
    <B><I><FONT face="Zurich BT">Pillar 1: Risk-Based Capital
    Requirements</FONT></I></B>
</OL>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Capital is the excess of a bank's assets (mostly loans
to the non-bank public, including security holdings) over its liabilities
(primarily deposits of the non-bank public).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Risk-based capital requirements demand that a bank's
capital (or equity) be at least as large as something specified as minimum
capital.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Minimum capital requirements act like a safety net
and are set based on the riskiness of a bank's assets. If a bank makes lots
of risky loans or holds risky securities, then it must hold more capital
-more of a safety net - than a bank that takes less risks. Thus capital
requirements act like sort of a charge on risky speculations. This helps
to curtail risky speculation (which can often serve to destabilize markets)
and provides institutions with a capital buffer big enough to absorb the
higher expected losses on the asset. In turn this helps reduce the need for
publicly funded bailouts of the banking industry such as what happened with
the S&amp;L Debacle and what seems to happen with IMF bailouts.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Advocates of the so-called Tobin Tax should be rather
fond of well-crafted capital requirements for banks and also other non-bank
speculators. Therefore it would be appropriate for such advocates to have
some input into BCA.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">To see how banks view capital requirements and to
see why they like this charge to be as low as possible (especially since
handy public bailouts are often available anyway) it is useful to look at
an example.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT face="Zurich BT">Example of the "Cost of Capital" Charge:</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">- Suppose shareholders have 10 units of equity capital
to invest in a bank.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">- Let's suppose the bank's assets will earn 5% and
its liabilities will costs 3%.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">- If capital requirements are at 10% assets, then
the bank can create a total of 100 units in assets by lending with 90 in
liabilities and 10 in capital. Then shareholders Return on Equity (ROE)
is:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">(100 * 5% - 90 * 3%) / 10 = 23%</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">- If capital requirements are at 5% assets, then the
bank can create a total of 200 units in assets by lending with 190 in liabilities
and 10 in capital. Then shareholders Return on Equity (ROE) is:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">(200 * 5% - 190 * 3%) / 10 = 43%</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Banks refer to the "cost of capital" as the earnings
that are given up by holding capital earning whatever the assets are invested
in (usually a low risk bond rate) versus the required shareholder return
rate, which for banks is normally around 20% after tax. In the case of the
example above we might like to calculate the cost of capital of the extra
5 units of capital that had to be held as capital in the 10% requirement,
but got to be released and invested in banking business (making loans) for
another 100 in loans in the 5% requirement.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The costs of capital of these 5 units is:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Earnings on 5 units in 5% Capital Requirement - Earnings
on 5 Units in 10% Capital Requirement</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">= (100 * 5% - 95 *3%) - 5% * 5 = 1.9</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">This equates to an ROE cost of 1.9/5 = 38% = 43% -
5%.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">So you can see why banks like lower capital requirements
on the same set of assets and why good risk-based capital requirements help
deter certain risky or speculative activities.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT face="Zurich BT">Minimum capital is defined in BCA as:</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">8% * Risk Weighted Asset Base</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The risk weighted asset base brings assets into capital
requirements commensurate with the risks associated with them. These risks
are:</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">Credit Risk = Default risk.</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">Market Risk = Risk of loss on market positions in
    the "Trading Book" (defined later).</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">(Note that Interest Rate Risk is NOT explicitly addressed
    here but rather is addressed under Pillar 2).</FONT>
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">Operational Risk = other risks such as computer failure,
    mistiming trades, fraud.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">In what follows I will focus primarily on Credit Risk
requirements because this is the primary risk for banks and is the main culprit
in financial crises. Explanation of how this risk is being treated under
the new BCA will serve to illustrate the direction things are headed in and
will sound most of the necessary alarm bells.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT face="Zurich BT">Credit Risk Assessment</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The contribution of bank assets (loans or securities)
to the risk weighted asset base for credit risk can be calculated using one
of these methods:</FONT>
<OL TYPE="I">
  <LI>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">Standardized Approach to Credit Risk: Each bank asset
    is assigned one of the following weights to enter into the Risk Weighted
    Asset Base;</FONT>

    &nbsp;
    <P>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">0%, 20%, 50%, 100% or 150%</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">The factor will be selected based on the claim
    counter-party type (sovereign, bank, corporate) and their rating from an
    independent body such as Standard and Poors, or the Export Credit Agencies.
    For claims such as retail mortgages a blanket 50% is used and for unrated
    entities a blanket 100% is used. Interestingly a risk weighting of 100% for
    commercial real estate is being proposed because this area has been so much
    of the cause of recent financial crises.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">Though a passing statement is made about higher risk
    weights for higher risk loans, no explicit mention is made of certain types
    of loans that caused great shocks to the financial system in the late 1990s.
    Specifically I am talking about the loans underlying the Long Term Capital
    Management (LTCM) crisis whereby major US banks lent heavily to this high-risk,
    highly leveraged hedge fund whose losses almost collapsed the global financial
    system. Given the growth in these hedge funds and similar vehicles, their
    tendency to get debt capital from banks on favorable terms, and the fact
    that they are NOT REGULATED because they involve "sophisticated investors"
    the BCA should address this explicitly. The unnamed high risk activities
    with discretion for setting capital requirements is an area wide open for
    abuse.</FONT>
    <P>
    <FONT face="Zurich BT">BCA also sets out the capital relief that will be
    given for various credit mitigation techniques, such as collateral against
    loans, guarantees, and credit derivatives. This is based on the amount of
    the asset covered by such risk mitigation techniques.</FONT> <BR>

the Standardized, IRB - Foundation and IRB - Advanced techniques.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Without going into this detail here I think it suffices
to use the terminology that the BCA uses - that sophisticated banks with
sophisticated risk management techniques will be the ones that get to set
their own capital requirements, which are then to be reviewed by the Bank
Regulators under Pillar 2. <B><I>This means that, generally, the self-setting
of capital requirements will be done by the largest international banks who
also suffer most from the "too-big-to-fail" moral hazard
risk.</I></B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">These are the same banks that tend to exercise power
over their regulators rather than the other way around. Furthermore the
complexity of both the methodology for the subjective approaches and the
complexity of the underlying financial instruments will make it very difficult
for the regulators to adequately monitor capital requirements. For example,
instruments like credit derivatives are very new, and will often be used
for purely speculative, as opposed to risk-mitigation, purposes. Self-setting
of capital requirements for such new, complex and speculative investments
is wide open for abuse. It is very interesting that the insurance industry
regulators do not yet allow such capital relief on credit derivatives.</FONT>

    Process</FONT></I></B>
</OL>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">This section of the BCA describes the role of bank
supervisors in making sure that banks are managing their risks appropriately.
This involves review of banks' risk monitoring techniques and ensuring that
banks comply with minimum capital requirements. Obviously this role of the
supervisor will become many times more complicated than it has been for those
classified as sophisticated banks. This is because of the level of subjectivity
and complexity involved in these banks being able to set their own capital
requirements.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">In my view an adequate supervisory effort in the context
of increasingly complex and subjective capital setting methodologies, in
conjunction with the convergence of financial services, the increasing
cross-border acquisitions, and the growing complexity of financial instruments
is becoming almost impossible for the largest financial players. As noted
earlier this is also where the "too-big-to-fail" moral hazard and associated
risk is also greatest.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Interestingly the current BCA draft states, in its
section on Pillar 2 that "Bank management clearly bears primary responsibility
for ensuring that the bank has adequate capital to support its risks". This
sounds very nice. If only it were true! Then we might have avoided so many
nasty financial crises whose costs were ultimately borne by the public and
generally by those who could least afford it. In this statement I would have
to say that the BCBS is wrong, and that this view they have is leading bank
supervisors down a very dangerous path. Because banks sit at the heart of
credit (money) creation - at the heart of the international monetary system
that we all depend on - it is the PUBLIC in general, not bank management,
who bear ultimate responsibility for whether or not the banks have adequate
capital and risk management techniques. The BCBS, and bank supervisors in
general, clearly need to be reminded of this as they seem to have forgotten
that they have any responsibility to the public at all.</FONT>
<P>
<B><I><FONT face="Zurich BT">Pillar 3: Market Discipline or Public
Disclosure</FONT></I></B>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">This includes disclosure of risk exposures and
calculations of risk-based capital, risk mitigation techniques, and comparison
of minimum capital to actual capital. Without seeing an example or explicit
list of reporting requirements it is difficult to know how detailed this
will be. Nevertheless it sounds like it has potential for the general public
to understand just what kind of risks the banking industry is getting us
into.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">What already has become clear is that the major banks
are complaining about the amount of detail of disclosure required under this
Pillar. However, given the statements above about who ultimately bears
responsibility for bank risks, the public should prefer very detailed disclosure,
and maybe even add some additional requirements - such as details of loans
rescued by the IMF.</FONT>
<P>
4.&nbsp;<A NAME="problems"></A><B><FONT face="Zurich BT"><FONT size=+1>Problems
with the new BCA from Public Interest Perspective</FONT></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Bank supervision and the setting of risk-based capital
requirements are very complex issues. Mandating risk-sensitive capital
requirements for banking book assets is very complex because of the diverse
range of complex assets and loan structures banks can invest in (or really,
create money for). The mandating of quantitative capital requirements tends
to lump together assets with different risk profiles into the same minimum
capital requirement class. This then leads to problems with banks investing
predominantly in the most risky of this class where the returns are higher,
but capital requirements the same, as for a lower risk asset.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">This reality played a major role in laying the foundations
for the Asian financial crisis whereby so many loans made by large creditors
were related to overpriced real-estate that didn't carry a capital charge
over safer loans. There is no question this was also a primary cause of the
Latin American Debt crisis, the aftermath of which helped create the first
round of Basel Accords. There is also little doubt that this facilitated
the Long Term Capital Management Crisis, heavily funded by large US
banks.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">It is highly likely that this problem of mandated
% capital requirements for broad asset groups and the extensive "regulatory
arbitrage" it generates is a large part of the rational behind the BCA
recommendations of Internal Ratings Approaches. Here banks largely set their
own capital requirements based on their internal assessments of risk for
the specific assets they hold. It is then thought that the supervisory role
of regulators and various disclosure requirements will ensure that banks'
capital levels and risk management techniques are adequate.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">In a world where bank regulators truly represented
the interests of the public, and the public had extensive oversight and input
into banking system operations and risk management, this would sound like
a pretty good idea. It would also require that bank regulators actually have
the resources and ability to properly monitor bank risk exposures and capital
levels, as well as the necessary authority to make banks improve their practices
where needed. Unfortunately none of these conditions hold today and this
is discussed in more detail in the following points.</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A NAME="supervision"></A><B><FONT face="Zurich BT">Trends in Bank
    Supervision</FONT></B>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">As noted earlier bank supervision has undergone radical
shifts in recent decades in part due to the worldwide convergence of financial
services - banking, brokerage and insurance - operations. This has created
large conglomerates involved in all aspects of financial services and resulted
in new regulatory structures in the form of "umbrella supervision" of the
new conglomerates. This has complicated financial supervision and also may
create a shift towards more uniform supervision across financial operations
(though we are not there yet, or even close).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The last major industrialized nation to merge financial
services was the United States in 1999. Under such changes the Federal Reserve
became the US Umbrella Supervisor of Financial Services Conglomerates, in
addition to retaining its previous powers as bank holding company and
state-chartered bank supervisor. While the US Government body known as the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency still retains some powers as supervisor
of national banks, today the Federal Reserve is the "king of regulators".
It seems that the Federal Reserve will have the ultimate responsibility for
the supervision of all big financial operators based in the United States.
It is the Federal Reserve in the United States who will ultimately oversee
the standards set by BCA, because BCA applies to the international players
that will be supervised by the Fed.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">This reality is potentially fraught with peril for
a number of reasons. First, although the Federal Reserve has some government
oversight its operations are disproportionately controlled by the private
banking sector itself, the very same group supervised by the Fed. This domination
by the banking sector comes partly from the role of the Federal Advisory
Council, who are the primary Federal Reserve Board advisors and are 100%
bankers. It also comes from the fact that most (67%) of the directors of
the 12 Federal Reserve Banks are appointed by the banks, and that the Federal
Reserve Board is generally dominated by Wall Street choices.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Second is the fact that the Federal Reserve is first
and foremost responsible for the monetary policy of the world's linchpin
currency, the US Dollar. The role of supervisor - concerned with safety and
soundness in the banking system - can and does often directly conflict with
the goals of monetary policy. This creates the potential for very harmful
conflicts of interest with worldwide consequences. A classic example of this
arose before the Latin Debt Crisis when the Federal Reserve, from a monetary
policy point of view, wanted to raise interest rates to squash inflation.
At the same time, based on earlier years' desire for credit expansion (a
monetary goal), the Federal Reserve (as bank holding company supervisor)
had allowed banks to expand loans well beyond what their capital levels could
support. So by the end of the 1970's past credit expansion had led banks
into a situation where defaults on Latin loans could not be swallowed by
their low capital levels, and the Fed's desired increase in interest rates
would surely trigger such defaults. The end result that solved this conflict
- hike up US interest rates, trigger the Latin Debt Crisis and have the IMF
and World Bank come in as lenders of last resort to bail out the US banks!
And who paid for this crisis for which the conflict of interest in supervisory
structure/monetary policy was largely responsible? The people of Latin America,
of course!</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The recognized dangers of having the umbrella financial
regulator be the same entity as that responsible for monetary policy are
illustrated by the fact that no other major industrialized nation has put
these two, often conflicting, functions under the same body. The fact that
this has been done only in the country that is responsible for credit creation
in the linchpin currency could have serious global ramifications as the example
of the Latin debt crisis indicates.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The situation in the United States before
Gramm-Leach-Bliley was that the Federal Reserve as bank holding company
supervisor would basically assign staff either from Washington and/or the
local regional Fed bank to work permanently on the supervision of the larger
banks. These staff work mostly on site at the big banks, sort of like permanent
fixtures there, or actually like staff of the banking group itself. These
close relations are likely to get even closer under the "self-regulation"
approach proposed by BCA for the larger banks, and don't bode well for
independent supervision of the larger banking entities.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The incredible complexities of monitoring the capital
adequacy of financial conglomerates in a world of increasingly complex
instruments and loan structures under the "self-regulatory" methods of the
Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach (specified by BCA) will likely made
adequate bank supervision a Herculean task! Given that a potentially talented
bank supervisor would makes pots more money working for the banks themselves,
the job is close to impossible and therefore wide open to abuse by those
banks most likely to adopt IRB. That is, the big banks, and the ones for
which bailouts are most necessary.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">These new rules have the potential to increase both
the frequency and severity of IMF bailouts by allowing more risks to be taken
and by allowing those most in need of bailout mechanisms the most leeway
for "bending the rules" during their "self-regulation".</FONT>

too-big-to-fail and, as noted earlier, will also be able to set their own
internally determined capital requirements. The incentives for abuse of minimal
capital requirements created by the "too-big-to-fail" moral hazard are
tremendous. This may also give the larger players extra competitive advantages
via lower capital charges and thereby facilitate more acquisitions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Furthermore these financial empires seem to be acquiring
greater powers over their own supervisors, meaning that supervisors may not
be able to control them anyway, even if they wanted to. Further compounding
the problem is that these same regulators are allowing mergers and acquisitions
to proceed unheeded. The best example of that recently was the Federal Reserve's
speedy approval of Citigroup's acquisition of the Mexican banking giant Banamex.
The Federal Reserve completely ignored all public opposition to this deal,
and gave no justification for its approval or for overlooking public complaints.
One can conclude from this that the Federal Reserve, now the financial regulation
king, does not consider itself at all subject to the discipline of democratic
accountability.</FONT>

    Crises</FONT></B>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">We saw earlier that some of the requirements in the
new BCA are aimed at addressing some of the causes and excessive risk taking
that ended in various crises such as the Latin American Debt Crisis, the
Asian Financial Crises and the US Savings and Loans Debacle.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Yet other areas of concern are notably absent. The
past few years have seen a rise in what are known as hedge funds which are
generally high risk, highly leveraged investment funds for the extremely
wealthy. They are also completely unregulated on the premise that they involve
"sophisticated investors". As we saw in the case of the Long Term Capital
Management fund, banks have been making significant loans to these hedge
funds without any corresponding capital charge commensurate with the risks
involved. Fortunately the banking industry was able to bail itself out of
this crises and the public did not have to bear the costs of the associated
recklessness. However the new BCA does not appear to address this increasing
risk of exposure to hedge funds explicitly at all. With no extra capital
charge on hedge fund financing, banks are probably taking excessive risks
in this area. This also exacerbates the risks that hedge funds introduce
into the markets by providing them with an easy source of financing.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The new BCA also does little to address the issue
of bank speculative activity, outside more traditional loans, and what risk
this introduces into the financial system in general. For example some
disincentive on speculative activity like currency attacks would go a long
way towards reducing major risks in the financial system.</FONT>

    <A NAME="predatory"></A><B><FONT face="Zurich BT">Credit Creation for the
    Poor and Predatory Lending</FONT></B>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The fact that under both the old and new BCA there
are no additional capital charges for sub-prime loans seems to have created
a situation whereby banks are originating a significant amount of sub-prime
loans to prime risks. This tends to happen with mortgages in the lower income
markets and, in fact, in 2000 the Chairman of Fannie Mae reported that about
one third of sub-prime home loans in the US actually could have received
a prime loan if credit assessment had been done properly.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">It seems that the lack of capital charge differential
has incented a number of banks to offer higher yielding sub-prime loans which
reflect a higher risk in the return but not in the capital charge. This has
had tragic consequences for these borrowers with many people losing their
homes in recent years. I am pretty sure that the folks who meet in Basel
don't have lower income customers much on their minds, therefore it is very
important for NGOs to make this point.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">In general the whole area of predatory lending and
credit creation powers over the poor must be addressed in bank supervision
standards and is currently nowhere to be found in BCA. In the US for example,
the banking industry has a long history of discrimination in providing credit
to various groups and a poor record of providing credit on reasonable terms
in low and middle income neighborhoods.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Part of the tremendous growth in both overseas lending
and sub-prime lending by US banks has surely been driven by the fact that
domestic non-bank corporations have sought financing from non-bank sources
such that only 20% of their financing actually comes from banks. This has
lead to banks increasingly accessing the retail and overseas markets for
credit creation. In both of these markets the banks have not behaved well,
and have abused their power over financially weaker debtors. Only stronger
bank supervision representing the interests of these debtors can help remedy
such problems.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Supervision of US financial holding companies by the
Federal Reserve does not bode well for any representation of the interests
of poorer and foreign creditors in bank supervision. The Federal Reserve
has a long track record of ignoring the interests of these groups and indeed
has been lax in enforcing standards such as the US Community Reinvestment
Act. A sneak preview of how the Federal Reserve may respond to interests
of these groups in the future was provided by the Fed's speedy approval of
Citigroup's recent acquisition of the Mexican banking group Banamex. In this
approval the Federal Reserve completely ignored all complaints from NGOs
representing low income groups who have been harmed by Citigroup's widespread
predatory lending abuses. The total non-response by the Fed to all complaints
about the merger has lead many observers to wonder whether Citigroup actually
supervises the Federal Reserve now.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">BCA does not cover non-bank financial institutions.
However we are seeing various countries' umbrella supervisors feeling the
pressure to streamline regulation in the wake of financial services
convergence.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">One the surface it might not make too much sense for
a non-bank lender to have different capital requirements than a lender with
a banking license. However it does make more sense if one considers that
banks are backed up by various bailout mechanisms including the IMF and FDIC,
due to their special status of being creators of money for the (M3) money
supply. Because of this central role in money creation it is more important
for confidence to be maintained in banks than in non-bank institutions. This
is what maintains the overall confidence in the international monetary system.
Therefore the likelihood of bailout is much higher for banks, particularly
the large ones, and bank capital requirements are of much greater interest
to the public than those of non-bank financial institutions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">That said, there could also be a very important role
for risk-based capital requirements on non-bank financial institutions to
curtail the type of speculative activity often responsible for causing crises
in the first place. People opposing the Bretton Woods institutions and advocates
of the Tobin Tax might want to keep this in mind as risk-based capital standards
develop across other financial players.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">The previous sections have been prepared to present
a case for public input into the Basel Capital Accord for the majority of
the public who are not aligned with the interests of big financial players,
but are certainly affected by such international banking agreements. Supervision
of banks and their risk management practices are important public issues
for reasons outlined above.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">However the unfortunate reality is that, of the 200+
public comments received by the BCBS, only 1 or 2 are public concerns from
outside the finance sector. These comments can be viewed at the BIS web site
at <A href="http://www.bis.org/">www.bis.org</A>. The majority of comments
coming from the larger banks (e.g. comments from Citigroup and the American
Bankers Association) are generally asking for more leeway in setting their
own capital requirements, and basically requesting lower capital standards.
Furthermore there have been many complaints from the big banks about the
proposed disclosure requirements.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Zurich BT">Originally the last comment period was supposed to
be the one ended May 31<SUP>st</SUP>, 2001 but due to the number of comments
about the current draft the BCBS has stated on its web site that it will
issue another draft for comments in early 2002. Hopefully this will provide
opportunity for various NGOs to compile and submit a list of concerns. This
document is intended as a discussion document to begin the process of collecting
comments and concerns from various NGOs working on monetary system
issues.</FONT>

  B.I.S. &#151; The Apex of Control
</H2>
<P>
This interplay of ideas and cooperation between Hjalmar Sehacht in Germany
and, through Owen Young, the J.P. Morgan interests in New York, was only
one facet of a vast and ambitious system of cooperation and international
alliance for world control. As described by Carroll Quigley, this system
was "... nothing less than to create a world system of financial control,
in private hands, able to dominate the political system of each country and
the economy of the world as a whole.12
<P>
This feudal system worked in the 1920s, as it works today, through the medium
of the private central bankers in each country who control the national money
supply of individual economies. In the 1920s and 1930s, the New York Federal
Reserve System, the Bank of England, the Reichs-bank in Germany, and the
Banque de France also more or less influenced the political apparatus of
their respective countries indirectly through control of the money supply
and creation of the monetary environment. More direct influence was realized
by supplying political funds to, or withdrawing support from, politicians
and political parties. In the United States, for example, President Herbert
Hoover blamed his 1932 defeat on withdrawal of support by Wall Street and
the switch of Wall Street finance and influence to Franklin D. Roosevelt.
<P>
Politicians amenable to the objectives of financial capitalism, and academies
prolific with ideas for world control useful to the international bankers,
are kept in line with a system of rewards and penalties. In the early 1930s
the guiding vehicle for this international system of financial and political
control, called by Quigley the "apex of the system," was the Bank for
International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland. The B.I.S. apex continued
its work during World War II as the medium through which the bankers &#151;
who apparently were not at war with each other &#151; continued a mutually
beneficial exchange of ideas, information, and planning for the post-war
world. As one writer has observed, war made no difference to the international
bankers:
<P>
The fact that the Bank possessed a truly international staff did, of course,
present a highly anomalous situation in time of war. An American President
was transacting the daily business of the Bank through a French General Manager,
who had a German Assistant General Manager, while the Secretary-General was
an Italian subject. Other nationals occupied other posts. These men were,
of course, in daily personal contact with each other. Except for Mr. McKittrick
[see infra] theft were of course situated permanently in Switzerland during
this period and were not supposed to be subject to orders of their government
at any time. However, the directors of the Bank remained, of course, in their
respective countries and had no direct contact with the personnel of the
Bank. It is alleged, however, that H. Schacht, president of the Reichsbank,
kept a personal representative in Basle during most of this time.13
<P>
It was such secret meetings, "... meetings more secret than any ever held
by Royal Ark Masons or by any Rosicrucian Order..."14 between the central
bankers at the "apex" of control that so intrigued contemporary journalists,
although they only rarely and briefly penetrated behind the mask of secrecy.
